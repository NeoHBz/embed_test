from beneath the awning of his scarlet command tent and in the half-light peered towards the ridge where the forces of his eldest son Khusrau were encamped.", "Beneath the clear skies the early morning in the semi-desert was chill.", "Even at this distance Jahangir could see figures moving around, some carrying flaring torches.", "Here and there cooking fires had been lit.", "Banners were silhouetted against the rising dawn in front of a large tent on the very crest of the ridge, presumably Khusrau\u2019s personal quarters.", "As he watched, a sudden sadness as chill as the morning air ran through Jahangir.", "How had matters come to this?", "Why would he face his son in battle today?", "Only five months ago, following the death of his father Akbar, everything he had wanted for so long had finally become his.", "He had been proclaimed Moghul emperor \u2013 the fourth of the dynasty.", "Jahangir, the name he had chosen to reign under, meant \u2018Seizer of the World\u2019.", "What a feeling it was to be master of an empire stretching from the mountains of Baluchistan in the west to the swamps of Bengal in the east and from the saffron fields of Kashmir in the north to the parched red plateau of the Deccan in the south.", "The lives of one hundred million people were subject to him and he subject to none.", "As he had stepped out on to the jharoka balcony of the Agra fort to show himself to his people for the first time as emperor, and heard the roars of acclamation rising from the crowds cramming the banks of the Jumna river below, it had seemed incredible that his father was dead.", "Akbar had brushed aside difficulties and dangers to create a rich and magnificent empire.", "Just as Jahangir felt he had never fully won Akbar\u2019s love nor lived up to his expectations during his life, suddenly he had doubted whether he could do so after his death.", "But, closing his eyes, he had made a silent promise.", "You have bequeathed me wealth and power.", "I will prove worthy of you.", "I will protect and build on what you and our forefathers created.", "The very act of making the vow had renewed his confidence.", "But then only weeks later had come the blow, struck not by a stranger but by his own eighteen-year-old son.", "Treason \u2013 and the climate of distrust it created \u2013 was always ugly, but how much worse when the instigator was his offspring.", "The Moghuls had often been their own greatest enemy, fighting one another when they should have been united.", "He could not, would not, allow the pattern to repeat itself and now, at the start of his reign, he would demonstrate how seriously he took familial disloyalty and how swiftly and utterly he would crush it.", "In the past few weeks nothing had mattered except closing the gap between his own forces and those of his son.", "Late the previous evening he and his army had caught up with Khusrau and encircled the ridge on which he was encamped.", "The more he thought of his son\u2019s treachery, the more a visceral anger surged through him, and he ground his heel into the sandy earth.", "Suddenly he was aware of his milk-brother Suleiman Beg at his side.", "\u2018Where have you been?\u2019 he demanded, his tone harsh with pent-up emotion.", "\u2018Hearing the latest reports from our scouts who got close to Khusrau\u2019s camp during the night.\u2019\n\n\u2018What do they say, then?", "Has my son realised he can\u2019t outrun us and must face the consequences of his rebellion?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes.", "He\u2019s readying his army for battle.\u2019\n\n\u2018How are he and his officers deploying their men?\u2019\n\n\u2018There are a few small sandstone Hindu cenotaphs on the ridge.", "They\u2019ve overturned their baggage wagons around them and are throwing up earth barricades to shield their cannon and protect their musketmen and archers.\u2019\n\n\u2018So they\u2019re preparing to withstand an attack rather than deliver one?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes.", "They know it\u2019s their best chance of success.", "Neither Khusrau nor his chief commander Aziz Koka is a fool.\u2019\n\n\u2018Except in defying my authority,\u2019 Jahangir broke in.", "\u2018Should I order our men to form up for an immediate assault?\u2019\n\n\u2018Before I decide, do we know if there is a spring or any water on the ridge?\u2019\n\n\u2018I questioned the single herdsman we came across last evening.", "He said no but he was so terrified he might have just been saying what he thought I wanted to hear.", "However, the ridge is mostly red dust and rocks with only a few dead-looking trees and scarcely a blade of grass.\u2019\n\n\u2018The herdsman\u2019s probably right, then.", "In that case, rather than attack immediately let\u2019s leave them to eke out what water they have a little longer while they ponder their fate in the fighting.", "Like Khusrau, most are young and inexperienced in war.", "Their imaginings will exceed even the worst horrors of battle.\u2019\n\n\u2018Perhaps, but not so many as I expected have taken up our offer to surrender.\u2019\n\nJahangir grimaced.", "The previous evening he had agreed to Suleiman Beg\u2019s suggestion that arrows should be fired into Khusrau\u2019s camp carrying the message that any junior officer or soldier who left Khusrau\u2019s camp during the night and surrendered would save his life.", "There would be no second chance.", "None could count on any mercy after the battle.", "\u2018How many gave themselves up?\u2019\n\n\u2018Fewer than a thousand, mostly poorly armed and clothed foot soldiers.", "Many are little more than boys who joined Khusrau\u2019s ranks as they passed in the hope of booty and excitement.", "A deserter told how one young soldier captured trying to escape was thrown alive into a blazing campfire on Khusrau\u2019s orders and held in the flames by spear points until his screams ceased.", "His charred body was then paraded around the camp to deter others from following his example.\u2019\n\n\u2018How many men does that leave Khusrau with?\u2019\n\n\u2018The deserters say twelve thousand.", "I think that\u2019s an understatement but there\u2019s certainly no more than fifteen thousand.\u2019\n\n\u2018We still outnumber them by three or four thousand men.", "That should be enough to compensate for our troops, as the attackers, being more exposed than Khusrau\u2019s men crouching behind their defences.\u2019\n\nAs he paced his command tent waiting for his qorchi, his squire, to ready him for battle, questions raced through Jahangir\u2019s mind.", "Had he done all he could to ensure success?", "Over-confidence could be as big a threat to a commander as the lack of it.", "Was the plan he and Suleiman Beg had devised, talking late into the evening, robust enough to give him victory in this, his first battle as emperor?", "Why hadn\u2019t he been prepared for Khusrau\u2019s treachery?", "During Akbar\u2019s lifetime Khusrau had tried to ingratiate himself with his grandfather, hoping to be named his heir.", "When Akbar had instead chosen Jahangir, Khusrau had seemed to accept it but had only been waiting his moment.", "On the pretext of inspecting progress in the construction of his grandfather\u2019s great tomb at Sikandra, five miles from Agra, he had ridden out of the Agra fort with his entourage.", "Instead of making for Sikandra, he had wheeled north towards Delhi, raising recruits as he went.", "The sun had risen high in the sky when Jahangir gathered his senior commanders for their final orders.", "\u2018You, Abdul Rahman, will lead our war elephants, together with a battalion of mounted musketeers and archers, round to the west where the ridge drops gently to the plain.", "Once there, you will advance up the spine of the ridge, making Khusrau believe that this will be, as conventional strategy might suggest, the route of our main attack.", "\u2018But it won\u2019t be.", "It\u2019ll be a diversion to tie down as many of Khusrau\u2019s forces as possible.", "Once I see you are fully engaged, Suleiman Beg and I will lead out another battalion of horsemen.", "First, we will feign a move west to support you, but then we will wheel and charge up the ridge directly in front of us towards Khusrau\u2019s tent on the crest.", "Ismail Amal, you will remain here to command the reserve and protect our camp against any attempt at plunder.", "Do you all understand the parts you are to play?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, Majesty,\u2019 came the immediate response.", "\u2018Then God go with us.", "Our cause is just.\u2019\n\n\n\nHalf an hour later, Jahangir was fully dressed for war, sweating beneath his steel helmet and the engraved steel breast- and backplates protecting his torso.", "Seated on his white horse, which was pawing the ground as if it scented the action to come, he watched Abdul Rahman\u2019s force advance at a steady pace, trumpets blaring, side drums beating with an ever increasing rhythm and green banners fluttering in the gentle breeze.", "As they were approaching the bottom of the spine of the ridge, puffs of white smoke rose from the nearest of Khusrau\u2019s positions as his artillerymen fired some of his larger cannon towards the attackers.", "However, the gunners were clearly nervous and unable to restrain themselves from firing too soon, because their first shots fell short, raising showers of dust in front of Abdul Rahman\u2019s advance.", "But then to Jahangir\u2019s dismay he saw one of his leading war elephants collapse despite its steel plate armour, spilling its howdah as it fell.", "Another elephant slumped to the ground.", "To Jahangir the attack seemed to falter but then, urged on by the mahouts sitting behind their ears, the remaining elephants surged past their fallen companions, advancing quickly for all their size up the ridge.", "Occasional spurts of smoke showed that the gajnals, small cannon, in their howdahs were being brought into action.", "At the same time, Jahangir could see his cavalry charging up the spine, green banners held aloft and lances extended as they leapt the makeshift red earth barricades and clashed with Khusrau\u2019s horsemen.", "Men from both sides fell and riderless horses galloped from the battle, some impeding the attackers.", "More and more drifting white smoke obscured Jahangir\u2019s view but not before he saw a squadron of horsemen, breastplates glistening in the midday sun, move quickly out from their positions in front of Khusrau\u2019s tents and turn to the west to reinforce their comrades against Abdul Rahman\u2019s onslaught.", "The crisis of the battle was upon him.", "\u2018Now it\u2019s time for us to go,\u2019 Jahangir shouted to Suleiman Beg as he pulled his ancestors\u2019 eagle-headed sword Alamgir from its scabbard and, rising in his stirrups, waved it to indicate to his trumpeters to sound the advance.", "Soon his white horse was moving smoothly into the gallop, raising dust as it pounded the ground in the planned feint to support Abdul Rahman.", "Jahangir\u2019s pulses were racing at the prospect of action.", "Despite his thirty-six years he had experienced far fewer battles than had his forebears at his age, partly because his father had refused to grant him military commands, partly because Akbar\u2019s successes had diminished the number of conflicts the Moghuls had engaged in.", "Now command was his, as the empire was his, and he would crush all challengers.", "He kicked his mount out in front of the rest of his men and then signalled them to wheel to make the frontal attack up the ridge.", "As they did so, twisting in the saddle Jahangir saw one rider and his chestnut horse crash to the ground, clearly having tried to turn too tightly.", "Another horse stumbled over the fallen chestnut, whose legs were thrashing the air as it tried to rise.", "Within moments both fallen mounts and their riders were submerged beneath the charge as it continued to gather pace despite the rising slope of the ridge.", "Crouched low over his white horse\u2019s neck, with his sword Alamgir extended before him, Jahangir concentrated on avoiding the many rocks littering the slope.", "Then he heard a crackle and a hiss as a musket ball passed his ear.", "He was almost upon the first of the earth barricades.", "Slackening the reins, he urged his horse to jump the obstacle, which was barely three feet high.", "The horse stretched willingly and leapt.", "As he rose over the barricade, Jahangir slashed at a tall musketeer sheltering behind it who was desperately trying to reload, ramming a fresh ball down into the long barrel of his musket.", "He never completed his task.", "Jahangir\u2019s heavy stroke caught him on the nape of his neck, crunching through bone and removing his head from his shoulders.", "Breathing hard, Jahangir was galloping on towards the crest of the ridge and what he assumed was Khusrau\u2019s command tent, still about half a mile away, when suddenly his horse\u2019s pace slackened.", "Glancing down, he saw two arrows protruding from its left flank.", "Crimson blood was already welling from the wounds to stain its white coat.", "Jahangir scarcely had time to think how lucky he had been \u2013 one of the arrows was embedded only an inch or two from his left knee \u2013 before the horse began to crumple and he had to throw himself from the saddle to avoid being crushed beneath it as it collapsed.", "Losing his helmet and his sword as he fell, he hit the stony ground with a thump which knocked most of the wind out of him.", "Rolling over and over, Jahangir attempted to curl himself into a ball and to protect his head with his gauntleted hands as he tried to avoid the hooves of the men who had followed him into the attack.", "Nevertheless, a flying hoof caught him a blow on his steel backplate before he came painfully to rest some distance down the slope against one of a group of jumbled rocks away from the charge of the horses and the main action.", "Dazed and with his ears ringing and his vision blurred, he was scrambling to his feet when he saw a man rise from the shelter of another group of dark rocks nearby and rush towards him brandishing a sword, clearly having recognised him and intent on the profit and glory his killing or capture would bring.", "Jahangir reached instinctively to his belt where his dagger had been in its jewelled scabbard.", "It was still there and he drew it quickly just as the man \u2013 a burly, rough-looking fellow wearing a black turban above a bushy beard \u2013 was upon him.", "Jahangir dodged his first attack but as he did so slipped and collapsed back to the ground.", "Gripping his heavy double-edged sword in both hands his assailant tried to bring it down into Jahangir\u2019s neck with all the force he was capable of, but he was too hasty and his clumsy stroke caught Jahangir\u2019s breastplate and skidded off, throwing the man off balance himself.", "Jahangir lashed out hard with his booted foot and felt a satisfying yielding of soft tissue as he caught his opponent full in the groin.", "The man dropped his weapon and doubled up, clutching at his battered, burning testicles.", "Seizing his advantage, Jahangir stuck his dagger twice into the hard muscle of his attacker\u2019s bare calf, causing him to stagger sideways and fall.", "Scrambling across the dusty ground, Jahangir flung himself on him and buried the long dagger deep in his exposed throat just by his Adam\u2019s apple.", "Blood spurted wildly for a moment and then the man lay motionless.", "Relieved but still on all fours and gasping for breath, Jahangir looked about him.", "Although it felt longer it was probably less than five minutes since he had fallen from his horse.", "Most of the fighting seemed to be going on further up the ridge.", "But then though his vision was still blurred he made out a mounted figure a little way off but fast approaching and, as far as he could discern, leading another horse.", "Jahangir rose unsteadily to his feet and tried to brace himself, ready for any new onslaught, but then he heard a familiar voice.", "\u2018Jahangir, are you all right?\u2019 It was Suleiman Beg.", "\u2018Yes, I think so .", ".", ".", "Do you have any water?\u2019\n\nSuleiman Beg held out a leather bottle towards him.", "Jahangir seized it in both hands, upended it and drank greedily.", "\u2018You should not have been so reckless in the charge.", "You outdistanced me and your bodyguard.", "The emperor should not expose himself in such a way.\u2019\n\n\u2018It is my fight.", "My son has rebelled against my throne and it is my duty to crush him,\u2019 Jahangir snapped, then added, \u2018How is the battle going?", "Give me that spare horse.", "I must return to lead the attack once more.\u2019\n\n\u2018I brought it for you \u2013 and I retrieved your sword,\u2019 said Suleiman Beg, extending both reins and weapon to Jahangir.", "\u2018But are you really sure you\u2019re all right?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 Jahangir said with more certainty than he felt.", "With Suleiman Beg\u2019s help he clambered into the saddle of his new mount, a rangy chestnut.", "To his relief his head was clearing all the time, and followed by Suleiman Beg and several of his bodyguard who had regrouped around him he pushed forward again back up the ridge towards the fighting around the tents.", "Khusrau\u2019s men were putting up stiff resistance.", "He could see horses rearing as their riders clashed with each other.", "Some of Khusrau\u2019s horsemen, seemingly recognising Jahangir and Suleiman Beg, broke away from the fighting and galloped downhill to attack them, yelling \u2018Khusrau zinderbad\u2019, Long live Khusrau!", "One made directly for Jahangir.", "As he approached, riding wildly, arms and legs flailing, Jahangir saw it was a younger brother of Aziz Koka.", "As the youth came closer he aimed a great swinging stroke at Jahangir with his curved sword but the emperor ducked and the blade cut through empty air two inches above his head.", "As the impetus of his downhill charge carried the rider onwards, Jahangir twisted in the saddle and caught him with a hard backhand sword slash deep into the flesh and bone of his upper arm, almost severing the limb.", "Losing control of his mount, the youth careered downhill towards Jahangir\u2019s camp until he was knocked from his saddle by a well-aimed shot from one of Jahangir\u2019s musketeers, stationed by Ismail Amal behind the shelter of an overturned baggage wagon to protect the camp.", "Looking about him with eyes now as sharply focused as usual, Jahangir saw that the other attackers had either been despatched or had retreated back up the ridge.", "Several bodies were strewn on the ground.", "Nearby, spreadeagled on his back, was a tall, saffron-robed man with a grizzled beard.", "A lance protruded bloodily from his belly.", "Jahangir recognised Tuhin Singh, one of his most loyal bodyguards \u2013 a Rajput from his mother\u2019s homeland of Amber.", "The man had guarded him for nearly a quarter of a century and now had given his life in battle for him.", "Only a few yards away, a slighter figure was twisting and writhing convulsively in the red dust, kicking his heels and clutching at his abdomen from which a skein of blue-red intestines was escaping.", "He was screaming in his agony for his mother.", "With a sharp intake of breath, Jahangir recognised the contorted beardless face as that of Imran, an even younger brother of Aziz Koka.", "He could be no more than thirteen years old and would surely never see another dawn.", "Fury at Khusrau, Aziz Koka and their fellow conspirators for causing so many deaths in their reckless hunger for power before their due time overwhelmed Jahangir.", "With a shout to Suleiman Beg and his bodyguard to follow, Jahangir kicked the chestnut up the slope.", "Soon he was smashing into the fray, hacking and cutting around him.", "A spray of warm blood from the neck of a rider he had struck with the full impact of his sword Alamgir caught him in the face and temporarily blinded him again.", "Quickly wiping away the blood with the sleeve of his tunic, he charged further into the heaving melee, surrounded by shouts and screams and the clash of weapon on weapon.", "The acrid smell of sweat and gunpowder smoke filled his nostrils and red dust in the air stung his eyes so that he could scarcely distinguish friend from foe.", "But he pushed onward with his bodyguard and Suleiman Beg in close attendance.", "With a final stroke of Alamgir, which caught one of Khusrau\u2019s men full on the kneecap, cutting deep into cartilage and sinew and almost jolting the sword from his hand once more, Jahangir was through the first line of battle.", "Looking up he saw that Khusrau\u2019s tents were now only four hundred yards away on the crest.", "However, as he watched, a large body of riders left them and disappeared down the other side of the ridge.", "As they went he saw \u2013 or thought he saw \u2013 Khusrau at their centre.", "\u2018After them.", "The cowards are fleeing,\u2019 he shouted to Suleiman Beg and his bodyguard, kicking the flanks of his chestnut mount as he did so.", "However, the animal was already blowing hard, nostrils flaring from its exertions in the previous fight, and unlike the fine white horse it had replaced it was not of the highest quality and stamina.", "By the time he reached the crest, Jahangir found that the fleeing group were already crashing into a line of his men stationed at the base of the ridge.", "After only a few moments, they burst through, losing only a single rider whose mount galloped on, reins dangling, after the rest who, still in close formation, were heading north across the plain.", "Kicking the chestnut on again, Jahangir set off in what in his heart he now thought would be a futile pursuit.", "His son was going to escape.", "Why hadn\u2019t he allocated more of his reserve to forestall any break-out?", "Then to his intense relief he saw another band of horsemen with green Moghul banners \u2013 not the purple Khusrau claimed as his emblem \u2013 appear from the west on an interception course.", "Abdul Rahman too must have spotted the move and despatched them.", "They were closing fast on the escapees.", "Jahangir urged his tired horse on down the far slope of the ridge with Suleiman Beg and his bodyguards at his side.", "But even before he reached the bottom, Khusrau\u2019s men had wheeled away from their pursuers and were galloping northeast, throwing up clouds of dust behind them.", "Then Jahangir saw four or five of Khusrau\u2019s rearguard turn and waving their swords charge back towards Abdul Rahman\u2019s force in a self-sacrificing attempt to buy more time for their comrades to escape.", "Before he had gone more than a few yards one of these brave men fell, arms outflung, from his black horse, hit by an arrow from one of the mounted archers Abdul Rahman had astutely included among the pursuers and Jahangir could just make out standing in their stirrups to loose off their weapons.", "The mount of another of Khusrau\u2019s men crumpled to the ground moments later, pitching its rider over its head.", "The others continued their charge and crashed into Abdul Rahman\u2019s leading horsemen who opened their ranks to receive and surround them, scarcely slackening their pace to do so.", "Less than a minute later Jahangir\u2019s men were riding hard again, heads bent low over their horses\u2019 necks, the bodies of several rebels and horses left sprawling in their wake.", "Khusrau\u2019s followers had taken at least a couple of their enemies with them into the shadows of death, but their courage would not save Khusrau.", "Abdul Rahman\u2019s men were now almost upon the fleeing group and two more of the rearguard, one carrying one of Khusrau\u2019s purple banners, pitched from their horses, presumably the victims of the mounted archers.", "The foot of the banner-carrier caught in his stirrup and he was dragged through the red dust for a hundred yards, his purple standard fluttering behind him.", "Then the stirrup leather snapped and man and banner lay twisted and still.", "As Jahangir urged on his chestnut, which, thin flanks heaving, was blowing ever more deeply in pursuit of the action, he saw Khusrau\u2019s men swerve aside once more but then come to a sudden stop near an isolated clump of scrubby trees.", "At first he thought they had decided to stand and fight but then through the dust billowing around them he caught the glint of discarded weapons lying on the ground.", "Having sacrificed so many others, like Aziz Koka\u2019s young brothers and the brave men who had attacked Abdul Rahman\u2019s vanguard, they were surrendering in an attempt to save their worthless lives.", "They would come to regret their decision not to die like men on the battlefield, Jahangir thought grimly as he dug his heels into the chestnut to squeeze from it its last ounce of strength.", "\u2018Bring them before me.\u2019\n\nWith the sweat of the fight still warm on him and anger still hot in his heart, Jahangir watched from the shade of the clump of trees as his soldiers dragged Khusrau, his commander-in-chief Aziz Koka and his master of horse, Hassan Jamal, forward and pushed them to their knees in front of him.", "Though the other two did not dare raise their eyes to the emperor, Khusrau was looking imploringly at his father.", "Beyond them, hands already bound behind their backs with strips of cloth ripped from their garments or saddle blankets, were the thirty or so of Khusrau\u2019s men who had surrendered with him.", "Jahangir\u2019s soldiers were shoving them roughly to the ground.", "Among them Jahangir suddenly recognised a tall, muscular man, his beard dyed red with henna.", "He remembered glimpsing him during the battle, a smile on his face, thrusting tauntingly with his lance at a young soldier who, knocked from his horse, was lying helpless and terrified in front of him, before finally impaling the youth through the abdomen.", "Such a furious rage seized Jahangir that for a moment he could hardly think.", "When he could it was about how he could punish such callous rebels sufficiently harshly.", "Then it came to him.", "For generations the Moghuls had executed the worst of offenders \u2013 child murderers, rapists and the like \u2013 by impaling them on stakes.", "His great-grandfather Babur, the first Moghul emperor, had done it with rebels and robbers too \u2013 that was the punishment these men should suffer.", "Despite the chance to surrender they had continued in rebellion, impaling those who were little more than boys on their lance points.", "Let them understand what impalement felt like.", "Let them suffer terror and pain.", "It would be only just.", "Without reflecting further he yelled to his soldiers in a voice hoarse with anger, \u2018Cut stakes from these trees with your swords or battleaxes.", "Drive them into the ground.", "Sharpen them as best as you can or tie lances to them and impale these traitors on them.", "Do it and do it now!", "Leave only my son and these, his two chief accomplices.", "Let them watch their men\u2019s agonies before they learn their own fate.", "Anticipation of what is to come may instil into them a little understanding of the suffering they have inflicted on others.\u2019\n\nAs his soldiers rushed to obey, some hacking at the trees with battleaxes, others digging at the ground with whatever implements they could improvise, including helmets, to make holes for the stakes while yet others seized hold of the captives and started hauling them across the ground, Jahangir felt Suleiman Beg\u2019s hand on his arm.", "Even before his milk-brother could speak Jahangir said, \u2018No, Suleiman Beg, it must be.", "They have brought it on themselves.", "They showed no mercy.", "Neither will I. I must make an example.\u2019\n\nJahangir saw Khusrau, still on his knees, watching with an expression of abject terror.", "At the thought of his son\u2019s treachery, of the needless sacrifice of so many good men, it was all he could do not to fall on Khusrau with his bare hands.", "After what seemed only about five minutes four of Jahangir\u2019s men lifted the first of the wildly kicking and struggling prisoners \u2013 a thick-set, hairy man whom they had stripped of most of his clothing \u2013 high in the air.", "Then using all their strength they brought his body down on one of the hastily erected stakes and lances.", "As the hard point penetrated his soft flesh near his rectum, his screams \u2013 more animal than human \u2013 split the air.", "Spurting blood reddened the ground as, with Jahangir\u2019s men pulling on the prisoner\u2019s legs, the stake emerged near his breastbone.", "Then as more rebels were impaled the stink of ruptured guts and of the excrement of terrified men who, on the brink of death, had lost control of their bowels began to rise.", "But Jahangir, still burning with his own anger and intent on harsh justice, barely noticed.", "Now was the time for Khusrau to witness close up the horrors for which his ambition was responsible.", "He strode forward and seizing his kneeling son by his shoulders pulled him roughly to his feet.", "\u2018See what you have done.", "These men are only suffering because of you.", "Walk through the stakes .", ".", ".", "go on,\u2019 he shouted, thrusting his face into Khusrau\u2019s.", "Then, releasing his son, he gave him a shove towards the stakes.", "But Khusrau, his arms wrapped tightly around himself and his eyes closed, attempted to turn away.", "Immediately Jahangir shouted to some of his bodyguards.", "\u2018Walk him past all the stakes and back again.", "Take your time.", "Make sure he looks at the bodies .", ".", ".\u2019\n\nStraight away two guards seized Khusrau by his arms and propelled him towards the stakes.", "With each step Khusrau\u2019s head drooped lower but every few paces his escort halted right in front of one of his dying supporters, writhing and kicking on a stake and in doing so impaling himself further, and one of the soldiers pulled back Khusrau\u2019s head by his hair, forcing him to look.", "But Khusrau had clearly had enough.", "Jahangir saw his son sag in the soldiers\u2019 arms and then collapse to the ground.", "He guessed he had fainted.", "\u2018Enough!", "Bring my son back here, together with Aziz Koka and Hassan Jamal.\u2019\n\nA few moments later, Jahangir surveyed the three men on their knees before him again.", "Khusrau\u2019s long dark hair was wet from the contents of the water bottle one of the guards had thrown over him to revive him.", "He was deathly pale, trembling violently and looked about to vomit.", "Raising his voice to make himself heard over the shrieks of agony still rising from the surrounding stakes where the remaining rebels were still being impaled, Jahangir spoke.", "\u2018You are all guilty of the worst crime a subject can commit against his emperor \u2013 armed rebellion.", "You\u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018I am not just a subject .", ".", ".", "I am your son .", ".", ".\u2019 Khusrau pleaded, his once handsome young face a mask of absolute terror.", "\u2018Silence!", "Ask yourself whether you have behaved like a son before you claim the rights of a son.", "You deserve no better treatment than those creatures for whose torment you, not I, are responsible, or the two men beside you.", "Aziz Koka, Hassan Jamal, you once swore loyalty to me but you broke your bond.\u2019 They stared up at him helplessly, their eyes rolling in fear as he went on, \u2018Expect no mercy, for I have none to give.", "You have acted with the treachery and heedless ambition of men but also with the blind stupidity of beasts.", "To symbolise your base animal natures, you will be taken to Lahore where in the bazaar you will be stripped naked and sewn into the freshly flayed skins of an ass and an ox.", "Then, seated backwards on the backs of asses, you will be paraded through the city streets in the heat of the day so that my loyal subjects may witness your shame and understand how ridiculous were your pretensions to overthrow me.\u2019\n\nJahangir heard the two men gasp.", "The idea for their punishment had come to him in a flash of inspiration only moments before he spoke.", "He knew his grandfather Humayun had prided himself on devising novel and sometimes bizarre ways of fitting punishments to the crime.", "Now so had he.", "However, he had no further time to waste on accomplices and so turned towards Khusrau who, his hands clasped in supplication, was sobbing brokenly and muttering something Jahangir couldn\u2019t catch but which sounded like gibberish.", "He drew himself up, preparing to utter the words that would send his son to his doom.", "\u2018Khusrau, you raised an army of disaffected traitors with the sole intention of overthrowing me \u2013 your father and the lawful Moghul emperor \u2013 and seizing my throne for yourself.", "You are responsible for the blood that has been spilled and in justice you should pay for that in blood.\u2019 The harshness of his voice was real and he meant every word he said.", "Khusrau knew it as well and in his fear lost control of his bladder.", "Jahangir saw a dark strain spreading through his cotton trousers and urine dripping on to the ground to form a yellow pool.", "A wave of pity for the state to which Khusrau had been reduced washed over him.", "Though moments earlier he had had every intention of ordering him to be beheaded, suddenly he no longer desired his death.", "There had already been so much bloodshed, so much suffering .", ".", ".", "\u2018But I have decided to spare you,\u2019 he heard himself say.", "\u2018You are my son and I will not take your life.", "Instead you will be kept in prison where over the months and years ahead you will have time to reflect on the transgressions that caused you to forfeit your liberty and your honour.\u2019\n\nAs Khusrau, Aziz Koka and Hassan Jamal were led away Jahangir turned to his milk-brother, who was still standing nearby.", "\u2018Suleiman Beg, order our soldiers to cut the throats of any impaled prisoners who are still alive.", "They have suffered enough.", "Have their bodies disposed of in a common grave, the stakes taken down and fresh earth spread over the ground.", "Have those wounded in the battle \u2013 whether friend or foe \u2013 treated by our hakims.", "Let all the dead have the funeral rites of their religion.", "I want to forget how much blood has been spilled today.\u2019\n\n\n\nA week later, in the fortress of Bagrat which he had made his temporary headquarters while his forces recuperated and reorganised, Jahangir studied the long letter he had just received from the Governor of Lahore reporting the fate of Aziz Koka and Hassan Jamal.", "As he read, Jahangir could picture the scene \u2013 the two struggling noblemen, all their dignity stripped from them, being stitched into the reeking bloody hides.", "The animals\u2019 heads had still been attached, the governor reported, and flopped about grotesquely with every desperate movement the prisoners made inside as they were paraded through the city while the population jeered and threw rotting vegetables and stones at them.", "Aziz Koka, sewn into the ass\u2019s skin, had suffocated as the hide had dried and contracted in the intense heat.", "Hassan Jamal had still been alive if almost unconscious when pulled from the ox skin.", "He was now in Lahore\u2019s dungeons.", "At the end of his letter, the governor asked whether Jahangir wished Hassan Jamal to be executed.", "Jahangir walked over to the casement and gazed out at the drear, sandy landscape.", "Now that he had had time to reflect on it, he was a little ashamed of the savagery of the punishments he had meted out even if they had been merited and would serve to deter other rebels.", "He had acted in the heat of the moment when his anger had been overflowing.", "Now he was calmer he was starting to wish he had behaved differently.", "Only a weak ruler need be afraid to show mercy .", ".", ".", "He had intended Hassan Jamal to die.", "It was only by some sort of miracle that the man had survived but it gave him a chance to show clemency that might begin to heal the rifts among his courtiers that Khusrau\u2019s rebellion had opened up.", "At once he summoned a scribe and dictated his reply to the governor.", "\u2018Hassan Jamal has been punished enough.", "Let him live.\u2019\n\nHe had given his son a harsh lesson, Jahangir mused as soon as he was alone again, but would Khusrau have learned it?", "He was headstrong, conceited and above all ambitious.", "Ambition wasn\u2019t easy to suppress, as he himself should know.", "Hadn\u2019t he spent nearly twenty years of his own life tormented by the fear that his father Akbar might deny him the throne he craved?", "Hadn\u2019t he rebelled himself?", "Just as he had done, Khusrau would have to wait to know whether he would name him, his eldest son, his heir despite his rebellion.", "And such a decision could wait.", "God willing, he had many more years left.", "But what about his other sons?", "His disputes with his father had kept him apart from them for long periods.", "On his return to Akbar\u2019s court he had found it difficult to rebuild ties as close as those between a father and his sons should be.", "Jahangir frowned as words spoken to him long ago by Shaikh Salim Chishti, the Sufi mystic who had foretold his own birth, flashed through his mind.", "As a young prince uncertain of what the future held he had sought out the old man.", "\u2018Watch those around you.", "Be careful whom you confide in and take nothing on trust, even from those bound to you by blood .", ".", ".", "even the sons you will have,\u2019 the Sufi had said.", "\u2018Ambition is double edged.", "It drives men to greatness but can also poison their souls .", ".", ".\u2019 He should heed that warning.", "After all, much that the Sufi had predicted had already come to pass.", "He had indeed become emperor and ambition had indeed corrupted one of his sons.", "Perhaps that was why his anger at Khusrau had burned so fiercely.", "He remembered how just two days before his battle with Khusrau, his army had occupied a small mud-walled village.", "Here the grizzled headman, after prostrating himself before Jahangir, had produced from a pocket of his grubby brown robe three small bronze coins which he claimed had been given to him by a party of Khusrau\u2019s scouts.", "With visibly trembling fingers he had handed them over to Jahangir in token of his submission.", "Inspecting them, Jahangir had seen that each of the seemingly hastily struck coins bore the image of Khusrau and the script encircling it had proclaimed Khusrau as the Emperor of Hindustan.", "Jahangir had been so overcome with anger that he had ordered the headman to be flogged for daring to retain the coins, the coins themselves to be immediately defaced by the farriers and a proclamation to be issued that henceforth anyone found with such coins would lose the fingers of his right hand as punishment for handling them.", "The headman\u2019s scrawny body had already been roughly stripped to the waist and bound to the only tree within the village compound while Jahangir\u2019s most muscular bodyguard made the air hiss as he practised the lashes with his seven-tailed whip before Suleiman had with difficulty persuaded Jahangir to pardon him.", "How fortunate he was to have Suleiman Beg by his side as he had since his youth \u2013 a loyal friend who instinctively sensed his moods and was now proving a wise adviser.", "But what would Parvez and Khurram \u2013 at sixteen and fourteen not so much younger than Khusrau \u2013 think about their half-brother\u2019s attempt to depose him and the punishment he had inflicted?", "Parvez\u2019s mother came from one of the old Moghul clans while Khurram\u2019s, like Khusrau\u2019s, was a Rajput princess and Khurram himself had been brought up by Akbar, who had shown him special favours.", "Both princes, but in particular Khurram, might think their claims to the throne as good as Khusrau\u2019s.", "At least he need have no worries yet about the ambitions of his youngest son Shahriyar, still living with his concubine mother in the imperial haram.", "As soon as possible he must return to Agra and his younger sons.", "He had demonstrated by his treatment of Khusrau and his followers that as emperor he could brook no dissent.", "But he would also show them that he was still a loving father, that it was only Khusrau\u2019s treachery that had forced his ruthless acts .", ".", ".", "Chapter 2\n\nThe Assassin\n\n\u2018You are sure you understand what to do?\u2019 Jahangir looked hard at the Englishman standing before him.", "This was only his second meeting with Bartholomew Hawkins but it had been enough to convince him that he was well fitted to the role of assassin.", "Hawkins spoke a crude, halting Persian picked up while serving as a mercenary with the Shah of Persia\u2019s army in Isfahan but enough for Jahangir to have been able to test him to his satisfaction.", "\u2018I will give you five hundred gold mohurs now for your journey to Bengal and back.", "When Sher Afghan is dead, I\u2019ll pay you another thousand mohurs.\u2019\n\nBartholomew Hawkins nodded.", "His broad face, reddened by the sun, looked satisfied.", "Even though he was standing some ten feet away Jahangir could smell the man\u2019s almost animal reek.", "Why didn\u2019t these foreigners wash?", "More and more were arriving at his court at Agra.", "Englishmen like this one, Frenchmen, Italians, Portuguese and Spanish, and all of them, whether missionaries, merchants or mercenaries, seemed to stink.", "Perhaps it was the clothes they wore.", "Hawkins\u2019s broad, sweating body was encased in a tight black leather jerkin, pantaloons that fastened with dark red ribbons just above the knee and dun-coloured woollen stockings.", "On his feet was a pair of scuffed riding boots.", "\u2018You don\u2019t mind how I kill him?\u2019\n\n\u2018No.", "All that matters is that he dies.", "If you merely injure him that\u2019s no use to me.\u2019\n\n\u2018Once I get to Gaur, how will I find this Sher Afghan?\u2019\n\n\u2018He is the city\u2019s governor and commands the garrison in the Gaur fort.", "Wait and watch and you will soon see him as he goes about his daily business.", "Any further questions?\u2019\n\nHawkins hesitated a moment.", "\u2018Will you give me a document \u2013 a letter with your seal perhaps \u2013 proving that I am in your service?\u2019\n\n\u2018No.", "Nothing must connect me with Sher Afghan\u2019s death.", "I am paying you to use your ingenuity.", "You told me you had undertaken sensitive missions for the shah.\u2019\n\nThe Englishman shrugged bulky shoulders.", "\u2018Then I have nothing further to ask.", "I\u2019ll leave tomorrow.\u2019\n\nWhen he was alone Jahangir walked slowly out on to the balcony of his private apartments overlooking the Jumna river.", "Would Bartholomew Hawkins succeed?", "He seemed tough enough and, unlike most of the other Europeans at court, could speak some Persian.", "But one of his main reasons for choosing him was that he was a foreigner.", "If he\u2019d sent his own men, they might have talked, albeit only to a friend or relation, and news of what he was planning might have reached Sher Afghan, giving him time to flee.", "That would be less of a risk with Bartholomew Hawkins, who had no clan or family loyalties to anyone in Hindustan and owed no man anything.", "He hadn\u2019t even asked why Jahangir wanted Sher Afghan dead.", "Such a lack of curiosity was an excellent thing .", ".", ".", "Jahangir had told no one the purpose of his meetings with the English mercenary.", "He would have confided in Suleiman Beg but his milk-brother was dead from the spotted fever.", "He had died as together they had returned from a short campaign against some of Khusrau\u2019s followers who had fled into the jungles southeast of Agra.", "Jahangir shuddered even now as he recalled Suleiman Beg\u2019s last moments lying in a humid, airless tent while the monsoon rains beat down from leaden skies on its roof only twelve short hours after he had fallen ill.", "He had quickly become so delirious that he had not even recognised Jahangir.", "His lips, covered in a scum of white saliva, had stretched into a scream while his sweat-soaked body had twitched and convulsed beneath the thin sheet that covered it.", "Then he had been still, leaving Jahangir no chance to bid him goodbye or to tell him how important his wise and restraining words had been throughout his rebellion against his father or during the recent dark days of Khusrau\u2019s revolt.", "To lose the companion he had trusted above all others just when everything was going so well seemed especially hard.", "In the ten months since Suleiman Beg\u2019s death there had been no further insurrections \u2013 not even the merest whiff of dissent.", "His empire was secure.", "The only threat had come from the belligerent ruler of Persia Shah Abbas who \u2013 if the reports brought by Abdul Rahman\u2019s scouts were true \u2013 was scheming to retake Kandahar from the Moghuls.", "However, the strong army equipped with twenty bronze cannon and two hundred war elephants that Jahangir had at once despatched to the northwest had made the shah think again.", "His crimson-capped troops had withdrawn long before Jahangir\u2019s forces were even within sight of Kandahar\u2019s high mud-brick walls.", "He still missed his milk-brother badly.", "Despite his wives and his remaining sons, his powers and his possessions, he felt alone \u2013 isolated even \u2013 in a way he had not while Suleiman Beg was alive.", "His boyhood had been filled with uncertainty, trying on the one hand to live up to the expectations of his father Akbar, a man who had never known failure, while on the other remaining loyal to his Rajput mother who had hated and despised Akbar as the barbarian subjugator of her people.", "Had it not been for his grandmother Hamida, always ready to listen to and encourage him, he would indeed have been lost.", "Suleiman Beg had been the only other person who had come anywhere close to occupying such a place in his life \u2013 a loyal and wise friend whose advice however unpalatable he had trusted among the self-serving counsel of his courtiers, vying for promotion and reward.", "Only yesterday he had gone to inspect progress on the domed sandstone tomb he had ordered to be built for Suleiman Beg near the Agra fort.", "As he watched the labourers chisel away at the slabs of stone his loss had struck him anew, and he had spent the evening alone with his thoughts.", "Suleiman Beg\u2019s death had reminded him as little else could have done of the transitoriness of life.", "No man however young or in however good health or good spirits knew the number of his days.", "Before death overtook him he must achieve all that he could but he must also enjoy life \u2013 as much or as little of it as remained \u2013 and why not use his power to allow him to do so?", "His musings had finally persuaded him to send for Bartholomew Hawkins and entrust him with his secret mission without further delay.", "Jahangir looked up at a sky that every day grew heavier and darker with rain clouds.", "In a very few weeks the monsoon rains would begin again.", "He hoped they wouldn\u2019t hamper Hawkins\u2019s journey down the Jumna and then the Ganges to Bengal.", "Though the rivers would soon be in full spate enabling the boats to make swift progress, the currents would become more hazardous.", "It wasn\u2019t an ideal time for such a mission but he was impatient.", "If Bartholomew Hawkins succeeded, he could take possession of the one thing \u2013 or rather the one person \u2013 that would make his life complete, even if the cautious Suleiman Beg might have questioned his methods of obtaining it.", "Bartholomew Hawkins slapped at a mosquito that had just bitten him on his jawline.", "Looking at his hand he saw that it was smeared with dark red blood.", "Good, he\u2019d got the bastard, though it was only a small victory against one of the armies of biting insects that were making his life such a trial.", "The horse he had purchased for the last stage of his journey to Gaur was old, its ribs sticking out bony as a camel\u2019s, but even the finest animal would find it hard to make much progress in the thick ochre mud.", "Only the thought of the thousand mohurs was keeping him going.", "Since leaving Agra he\u2019d had two prolonged bouts of fever \u2013 his sweat had soaked him, his garments and his bedding \u2013 and one of such ring-stinging liquid diarrhoea and agonising stomach cramps that he\u2019d vowed \u2013 and meant it \u2013 to take the first ship he could find when he reached the coast and sail home to England.", "But at least when he\u2019d had his last bout of fever he\u2019d still been on a riverboat and an old white-clad, white-haired Hindu priest with kind brown eyes had looked after him.", "Yet when Bartholomew had tried to press a coin into his hand the man had recoiled.", "He\u2019d never understand this country.", "Peering ahead in the fading light, he could just make out the rear of the Gaur-bound mule train that he had attached himself to.", "Preoccupied with driving their laden beasts over the boggy ground, none of the merchants had shown any interest in him which was good although he had his story ready \u2013 he was a Portuguese official on his way to the trading settlement of Hooghly near the mouth of the Ganges to enquire into the prospects for increasing trade in indigo and calicoes.", "He looked nothing like an official \u2013 nor, come to that, a Portuguese given his curly red-gold hair and pale blue eyes \u2013 but these people didn\u2019t know that.", "Or that in his saddlebags were two very fine steel daggers: one a Persian weapon with a blade so sharp it could split the hair of a horse\u2019s tail and the other a Turkish one with a curved blade engraved \u2013 or so he\u2019d been told by the Turkish armourer who\u2019d sold it to him \u2013 with the words I will kill you but whether you go to Paradise or to hell is God\u2019s will.", "The emperor\u2019s demeanour had suggested he\u2019d far rather Sher Afghan went to hell but he\u2019d revealed nothing about why he wanted the man dead.", "Bartholomew reached for his leather bottle and took a gulp of water.", "It was warm and fetid-tasting but he\u2019d long ago ceased to worry about such things.", "All he prayed was that he wouldn\u2019t be seized with another attack in his bowels.", "Restoppering the bottle his thoughts returned to Jahangir, how intent the dark eyes in that handsome fine-boned face had looked as he\u2019d given Bartholomew his orders.", "Despite his fine brocades and the glittering rings on every finger, Bartholomew had detected a man perhaps not so unlike himself .", ".", ".", "a man who knew what he wanted and was prepared to be ruthless in pursuit of it.", "He had also noted the whitened scars \u2013 one on the back of Jahangir\u2019s left hand and another running up his right brow into his hairline.", "The emperor knew about the art of killing too.", "Suddenly Bartholomew heard men shouting to one another up ahead.", "Instinctively he felt for his sword in case robbers \u2013 dacoits the local people called them \u2013 were falling on the mule train.", "Such attacks often happened at dusk when the enfolding darkness gave cover to the robbers and the merchants were growing tired.", "Three nights ago at that time Bartholomew had saved a puny carpet seller.", "The man had stopped in drizzling rain to redistribute the load from a mule that had become lame among his other beasts.", "He had been struggling with a rolled carpet almost as large as himself when two bandits had trotted up out of the darkness.", "Jumping down from their ponies, one had kicked the carpet dealer to the ground while the other had begun gathering the reins of the mules, preparing to lead them away.", "Both were so preoccupied they never saw Bartholomew, galloping out of the murk, until it was too late.", "Drawing his Toledo steel sword he had almost severed one man\u2019s head from his shoulders and split the other\u2019s skull like a ripe melon.", "The carpet seller\u2019s gratitude had been overwhelming and he\u2019d tried to force a rug on him.", "But Bartholomew had already been regretting his actions.", "If he was to carry out his mission and win his reward, he must not attract attention.", "But now the reason for the shouts wasn\u2019t dacoits.", "The cries were of relief and joy, not fear.", "Ahead of him Bartholomew could see watchtowers silhouetted against the remnants of the sunset \u2013 it was Gaur.", "Bartholomew let go of his sword hilt and gave his sweating horse a pat.", "\u2018Not long now, you wretched old nag.\u2019\n\n\n\nWhat was all that commotion in the courtyard at this hour?", "Bartholomew wondered irritably as he lay on the straw-filled mattress in the small room he\u2019d rented in a caravanserai just inside the walls of Gaur by the main gate.", "He sat up and scratched vigorously then clambered to his feet and without bothering to pull on his boots went outside.", "Though it was barely dawn, merchants were laying out their wares on a great stone platform in the centre of the courtyard ready to begin trading: sacks of spices, bags of rice, millet and maize, rolls of dun-coloured cotton and of garish silks.", "Bartholomew surveyed them without interest but as he turned away he found the carpet seller he had rescued looking up at him.", "\u2018Gaur is a fine city, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Very fine,\u2019 Bartholomew said mechanically.", "He was about to go back to his room \u2013 he could do with an hour or two\u2019s more sleep \u2013 but then a thought struck him.", "\u2018Hassan Ali \u2013 that is your name, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\nThe man nodded.", "\u2018Hassan Ali, you know Gaur well?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes.", "I come here six times a year and two of my cousins are traders here.\u2019\n\n\u2018You said you wanted to repay me for my help.", "Be my guide.", "I don\u2019t know this place and my employers in Portugal wish me to send them a full report of it.\u2019\n\nAn hour later Bartholomew followed Hassan Ali across the square courtyard of the caravanserai and out through its high arched gateway into the streets of Gaur.", "At first with its narrow, refuse-strewn streets it looked a mean place but as Hassan Ali, walking with surprising speed for such a small man, led him towards the centre the streets began to broaden and the houses \u2013 some of them two storeys high \u2013 to become more handsome.", "Bartholomew also noted the many groups of soldiers they passed.", "\u2018Where are they going?\u2019 He pointed to a double row of twenty green-sashed, green-turbaned warriors marching by.", "\u2018They were the detachment guarding the city\u2019s gates during the night but they have now been relieved and are returning to their barracks.\u2019\n\n\u2018Where are they?\u2019\n\n\u2018Not far.", "I will show you.\u2019\n\nA few minutes later Bartholomew looked up at a tall square fortress-like building with a parade ground in front of it.", "Built of mud bricks, its walls rose about fifty feet.", "As he watched, a group of horsemen, doubtless returning after exercising their mounts, trotted through the heavy metal-spiked gate that was the barracks\u2019 single entrance.", "\u2018It\u2019s a fine building.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes.", "It was built by the Emperor Akbar \u2013 may his spirit rest in Paradise \u2013 after his conquest of Bengal.", "He also reinforced the city walls and built the fine caravanserais that we have here.", "He was truly a great man.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sure.", "Who commands the Moghul troops here?", "He must be an important man to be so favoured by the emperor.\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know his name.", "I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not important.", "I was merely curious to know who was entrusted with such a task.", "Hindustan is so huge compared with my own country.", "There, it is far easier for a monarch to control his lands and to know what is going on .", ".", ".\u2019\n\n\u2018It is true.", "Our empire is without parallel in the world.\u2019 Hassan Ali nodded complacently.", "\u2018Come.", "Let me take you to the great bazaar where much trading is done in addition to that in the caravanserais.\u2019\n\nThey were just turning away when the harsh metallic blaring of a trumpet made them halt.", "Moments later twelve soldiers splendidly mounted on matching bay horses cantered out of a side street and across the parade ground towards the barracks.", "One of them was holding the short brass trumpet he must have just sounded to signal their arrival.", "They were followed by three further riders \u2013 two in domed helmets riding on either side of a tall man who was looking to neither right nor left and whose long dark hair flowed from beneath a white-plumed helmet.", "Bartholomew\u2019s pulses quickened.", "He glanced around for Hassan Ali and saw him conversing with a melon seller in a grimy dhoti.", "Bartholomew listened hard but couldn\u2019t understand what they were saying.", "It must be a local language, he thought.", "It certainly wasn\u2019t Persian.", "The melon seller seemed to have a lot to say.", "He had emerged from behind his mounds of cylindrical yellow-green fruits and was talking vigorously and pointing to the barracks into which the man with the plumed helmet and his escort had now disappeared.", "\u2018Sir,\u2019 said Hassan Ali, \u2018the commander of the garrison is called Sher Afghan.", "That was him we just saw.", "The melon seller told me he is a great warrior.", "Two years ago the late emperor sent him to the jungles and swamps of Arakan east of here to deal with the pirates living there.", "It is a terrible place, infested with crocodiles, but Sher Afghan triumphed.", "He captured and executed five hundred pirates, throwing their bodies on to pyres of their own burning boats.\u2019\n\n\u2018Does he live in the barracks?\u2019\n\n\u2018No.", "His mansion is in a large garden to the north of the city, by the Swordmaker\u2019s Gate.", "Now, let us go to the bazaar.", "You will find much to interest you there .", ".", ".", "last time I was here I saw a painted wooden figure of one of your Portuguese gods.", "It had golden wings .", ".", ".\u2019\n\n\n\nBartholomew bided his time.", "Every day the rains still came, hot and heavy, the drops bouncing up from the paved courtyard of the caravanserai.", "In between the showers he put on the hooded dark brown robe he had purchased in the bazaar to make his appearance less remarkable and walked around Gaur until he had fixed in his mind every twist of every street, every alley, in the area between the barracks and Sher Afghan\u2019s house.", "He also observed his intended victim\u2019s movements which, apart from the odd day\u2019s hunting or hawking when the weather allowed, seemed surprisingly regular.", "Nearly every afternoon, Sher Afghan spent several hours in the barracks.", "On Mondays he reviewed his troops on the parade ground, watching their displays of musketry practice, and on Wednesdays he inspected some part of the city\u2019s defences.", "During the long journey from Agra Bartholomew had pondered how best to find an opportunity to kill Sher Afghan.", "He smiled to think he had even contemplated trying to pick a quarrel with him as if Gaur were an English town where he and Sher Afghan might meet and brawl in a tavern.", "Now he had seen not just the muscular strength of the man but that a bodyguard accompanied him everywhere the idea had less to commend it.", "Whatever he did must be by stealth.", "It might be possible to find a vantage point from which to aim an arrow or hurl a dagger but the chances of even wounding him, let alone of killing him outright, were slender.", "Jahangir had made it absolutely clear that he wanted Sher Afghan dead.", "But on a clear day when the rains seemed finally to be easing and there was a new freshness in the air, the solution came to Bartholomew.", "It was so obvious and simple \u2013 though not without danger to himself \u2013 that he grinned as he wondered why he hadn\u2019t thought of it before.", "Two weeks later, towards eleven o\u2019clock in the evening \u2013 an hour before the caravanserai\u2019s gates would be locked for the night \u2013 Bartholomew slipped out of his room, giving a parting kick to the sweat-stained straw-filled mattress on which he\u2019d spent so many uncomfortable nights.", "Beneath his dark robe, his sword in its scabbard was suspended from a steel chain round his waist as were his two daggers, the Turkish blade on his right side and the Persian weapon on his left.", "He had cut slits in the coarse cloth of his robe to ensure he could reach for them quickly.", "Bartholomew swiftly crossed the caravanserai\u2019s courtyard and went out through its arched entrance past the sleeping gatekeeper who was supposed to keep watch for late arrivals seeking a bed for the night for themselves and stabling for their animals.", "Once outside he glanced swiftly around him to make sure he was alone.", "Then he set off through the quiet, narrow streets.", "He\u2019d walked this precise route many times and knew exactly where it was taking him as he headed across the parade ground and past the barracks towards the north of the city.", "Reaching a small Hindu temple where tapers burned in a brass pot before the image of an elephant god, Bartholomew turned down an alley where the overhanging upper storeys of the houses were so close they almost touched.", "He caught the soft sound of a woman singing from one house and the crying of a baby from another.", "Here and there the orange light of oil lamps flickered through the carved wooden jalis covering the windows.", "Suddenly Bartholomew\u2019s foot caught something soft.", "It was a dog whose reproachful whimper followed him as he continued his leisurely progress.", "There was no need to hurry and anyway a man in a hurry always attracted more attention.", "The alley was broadening out, and as it curved round to the left it gave on to a large square.", "Bartholomew had seen it at every time of day and night.", "He knew how many neem trees shaded the stallholders peddling their wares in the heat of the day, how many other streets and alleys led into it and how many men would be guarding the tall house directly opposite him at the far end of the square.", "Pulling his hood still lower over his face, Bartholomew peered cautiously round the corner into the square.", "The new moon was shedding hardly any radiance but the glow from braziers burning on either side of the house\u2019s metal-bound gates showed that \u2013 just as on other nights \u2013 four guards were on duty.", "It also showed that a green banner was flapping from a gilded pole above the gates \u2013 the sign, as he had discovered from Hassan Ali, that the commander was at home.", "All seemed very quiet.", "Had any sort of party or feast been in progress he would have had to postpone his plan .", ".", ".", "Having seen what he wanted, Bartholomew drew back into the shadows of the alley and, turning, began to retrace his steps.", "After a hundred paces or so he came to a small street branching off to the left.", "In the daytime it was full of vegetable sellers raucously pressing their own wares on passers-by and deriding their competitors\u2019 produce, but now it was silent and empty.", "Bartholomew walked along it, the leaves of rotting vegetables slippery beneath his feet and the air reeking of their decomposition, but his mind was on other things.", "This street curved round behind the square.", "In a few hundred yards it would pass close to the western wall of the fine gardens behind Sher Afghan\u2019s house.", "The wall was quite high \u2013 at least twenty feet \u2013 but there were enough foot- and handholds in the brickwork to make climbing it possible, as he knew.", "On the past two nights he had hauled himself over it, choosing a place where a tall clump of bamboo was growing on the other side, to drop down amongst the dense vegetation.", "Crouching amongst the leafy bamboos he had listened and watched.", "Through the swaying stems he had been able to make out a courtyard with a bubbling fountain and beyond it the dark walls of the house.", "Metal gates identical to those at the front led inside the house but with two important differences.", "They were kept open \u2013 beyond them he had glimpsed an inner courtyard \u2013 and they were also only lightly guarded.", "At night, a watchman \u2013 no more than a youth as far as Bartholomew could tell from his slight frame \u2013 sat on a wooden stool just inside the gates.", "He appeared to have no weapon \u2013 only a small drum to beat to rouse the household in case of danger.", "But what danger could Sher Afghan be expecting?", "He was the commander of a garrison in a quiescent \u2013 albeit distant \u2013 part of a peaceful and powerful empire.", "The soldiers guarding the front gate were probably more for show than anything else.", "Once again Bartholomew found himself wondering why the emperor wanted this man dead and why \u2013 all-powerful as he was \u2013 he had chosen this way of getting rid of him.", "If Sher Afghan had committed some crime why didn\u2019t Jahangir just execute him?", "He was emperor after all.", "But then that was none of his business.", "All that mattered were the thousand mohurs.", "Reaching the wall without incident, Bartholomew glanced about him to make sure yet again that no one was around.", "Satisfied, he hitched up his dark robe and began to climb.", "This time for some reason, perhaps nerves or impatience to get the job done, he didn\u2019t choose his handholds so well.", "When he was already about fifteen feet up, the corner of a brick he was grasping in his right hand crumbled and he nearly fell backwards to the ground.", "Digging his toes hard into crevices between the bricks and hanging on with his left hand \u2013 he could feel blood oozing from beneath his nails \u2013 he managed to steady himself.", "Stretching his right arm higher he probed the rough surfaces until he found a place that felt secure.", "With one more big heave he was on top of the wall.", "Brushing the sweat from his face he carefully lowered himself down the other side, letting go when he was still ten feet above the ground to drop into the space he had found among the bamboos.", "Squatting down, heart pounding, he listened.", "No sounds, nothing.", "That was good.", "It must be after midnight now but it was still too early to make his move.", "He shifted a little to make himself more comfortable.", "He felt some small creature \u2013 a mouse or a gecko \u2013 run over his foot and heard the familiar whine of mosquitoes.", "Frowning slightly, he focused his mind on the task ahead.", "It was about one in the morning when Bartholomew began moving slowly towards the house, keeping under cover of the bamboos and then of the spreading branches of a thickly leaved mango tree.", "In the moonlight, he could see the watchman, young head slumped on his chest and clearly fast asleep on his stool.", "Beyond him the inner courtyard, lit only by small torches burning in brackets on the wall, was quiet and still.", "Bartholomew darted across the garden past the still playing fountain to the wall of the house, choosing a place a little to the left of the gates that was overshadowed by a projecting balcony.", "Flattening his back against the wall he closed his eyes for a moment as he steadied his breathing.", "Then he began edging towards the gates.", "Reaching them he paused and peered inside.", "He was so close to the watchman that he could hear his light snores.", "But there was no other sound.", "Tensing his muscles, he sprang forward through the doors, grabbed the youth from behind with both arms and hauled him out into the garden, right hand clamped firmly over his mouth.", "\u2018One sound out of you and you\u2019re dead,\u2019 Barthlomew whispered in Persian.", "\u2018Do you understand me?\u2019 The youth\u2019s eyes were wide with fright as he nodded.", "\u2018Now take me to where your master Sher Afghan is sleeping.\u2019\n\nThe youth nodded again.", "Gripping the nape of the young watchman\u2019s neck with his left hand so firmly that his nails dug into the flesh, and with his right drawing his curved-bladed Turkish dagger from its oxhide scabbard, Bartholomew followed him across the inner courtyard, through a doorway in the corner and up a flight of narrow stone stairs to a long corridor.", "He could feel the youth trembling like a frightened puppy beneath his grip.", "\u2018Here, sir.", "This is the room.\u2019 The boy halted outside a chamber with highly polished doors of some dark wood inlaid with brass tigers.", "Bartholomew thought he could smell some spicy perfume \u2013 frankincense perhaps \u2013 and tightened his hold on the youth, who looked round, brown eyes terrified.", "Without warning he opened his mouth to cry out an alarm.", "Bartholomew didn\u2019t hesitate.", "In two rapid movements he jerked back the boy\u2019s head with his left hand and with his right raised his bright-bladed Turkish dagger and drew it across the smooth-skinned throat.", "As the youth\u2019s last breaths bubbled through the gaping wound he laid the limp body down.", "In other circumstances he might have spared him, but not here where he could so easily lose his own life if he made a mistake.", "Instinctively he wiped the bloody dagger on his robes.", "All his thoughts were on what he would find on the other side of those dark doors with their gleaming tigers.", "He\u2019d heard it said that \u2018sher\u2019 meant \u2018tiger\u2019 \u2013 if so he was in the right place and Sher Afghan was just a few feet away.", "Still holding his dagger in his right hand, with his left Bartholomew carefully raised the ornate metal latch \u2013 again fashioned like a tiger \u2013 on the right-hand door and gave a gentle exploratory push.", "To his relief the door opened smoothly and quietly.", "When it was about six inches ajar he stopped.", "A shaft of pale golden light told him the room he was about to enter was not in darkness as he had hoped.", "Perhaps Sher Afghan had already seen the door swing open and was even now drawing his sword .", ".", ".", "Bartholomew hesitated no longer but pushed the door wide and stepped inside.", "The large room was hung with red silk embroidered with gold thread.", "Soft thick carpets were beneath his feet and a spiral of smoke was rising from some crystals glowing in an enamelled incense burner.", "Wicks were burning in oil-filled bronze diyas.", "But Bartholomew\u2019s gaze was on none of these things.", "He was staring through the almost transparent pale pink muslin curtains drawn across the room to divide it in two.", "Through the fabric he could see a large low bed and upon it two intertwined naked bodies, a man and a woman.", "The man at least was so absorbed in his lovemaking that Bartholomew could have probably kicked the door open without his noticing.", "The woman was on her back, slender legs hooked around the man\u2019s muscular hips as he thrust and her view of the door obstructed by her lover\u2019s body.", "Providence could not have given him a better opportunity, Bartholomew thought as he came nearer.", "Carefully, he slipped through the muslin curtains and treading softly approached the bed.", "He was now so close he could see the sweaty sheen on the man\u2019s body and smell the salty tang of it but both he and the woman, whose head was turned aside, her eyes closed, were still oblivious of his presence.", "Close to climax, with each thrust Sher Afghan was joyously throwing back his head.", "As he did so, Bartholomew leapt forward, grabbed him by his thick black hair, yanked his head back even further and neatly severed his jugular.", "Bartholomew was a skilled killer.", "Just like the gatekeeper, Sher Afghan made not a sound as his hot red blood pumped from the gaping wound.", "Bartholomew grabbed hold of the heavy body, stared for a moment into the still open eyes to reassure himself that it was indeed Sher Afghan, then pushed it to the floor and turned his attention to the woman who had now opened her eyes and was sitting up, knees drawn up defensively.", "Her lover\u2019s blood was running down between her opulent breasts and her dark eyes were fixed on his face as if trying to predict what he would do next.", "\u2018Don\u2019t make a noise and I won\u2019t hurt you,\u2019 he said.", "Slowly, her gaze never leaving his face, she pulled up a sheet over her but said nothing.", "He was relieved \u2013 he didn\u2019t want to kill a woman any more than he had wanted to kill the young watchman \u2013 but at the same time he was surprised.", "He\u2019d have expected someone in her situation to scream hysterically or shout abuse but she didn\u2019t look as devastated as she might have that the man who just moments earlier had been passionately and vigorously making love to her was lying in a pool of congealing blood on the floor.", "Instead her expression was almost one of curiosity.", "He realised she was taking in every detail from his dark, grubby robe and blood-smeared hands to the stray curls of red-gold hair slipping from beneath the length of dun-coloured cloth he\u2019d wound round his head.", "He turned to go.", "He\u2019d stayed too long already.", "Backing away just in case she had a weapon concealed somewhere, he reached the doors, expecting any moment to hear her scream out for the guards.", "But he was through the door, down the corridor and hurling himself down the stone steps into the silent and now empty courtyard before, at last, he heard a woman\u2019s shrill cry of \u2018Murder!\u2019 As he ran through the dark gardens he heard a commotion break out behind him \u2013 men\u2019s voices, the sound of running feet \u2013 but he was nearly at the wall now.", "Forcing his way through the tough bamboos, not caring how he scraped or scratched himself, he flung himself at the wall and scaled it, this time without difficulty.", "Back in the street he paused for a moment.", "Taking his Turkish dagger, still stained with Sher Afghan\u2019s gore, he kissed it lightly.", "The thousand mohurs were his.", "Chapter 3\n\nThe Widow\n\n\u2018We have prepared and washed your husband\u2019s body ready for burial,\u2019 said the hakim.", "\u2018I thought that before we laid him in his coffin you would wish to assure yourself that everything has been done exactly as you instructed.\u2019\n\n\u2018Thank you.\u2019 Mehrunissa stepped closer and stared down at her husband\u2019s corpse.", "\u2018Leave me, please .", ".", ".\u2019 When she was alone she leaned over the body and scrutinised Sher Afghan\u2019s face, which looked surprisingly peaceful for a man who had met such a violent end.", "She could smell the astringent odour of the camphor water with which the hakim and his helper had cleansed him.", "\u2018I\u2019m sorry you died in such a way,\u2019 she whispered, \u2018but I\u2019m not sorry I\u2019m free of you.", "If the killer had struck me down instead of you, you wouldn\u2019t have cared.\u2019 For a moment she touched her husband\u2019s cheek with her fingertips.", "\u2018Your flesh is cold now, but you were always cold to me and to our daughter, who meant nothing to you because she was not born a boy .", ".", ".\u2019\n\nMehrunissa felt tears welling, but not for Sher Afghan.", "Though she despised self-pity they were for herself and her wasted years with a man to whom, once he had secured her dowry, she had become only an object on which to satisfy his lust and to demonstrate his power.", "She had been barely seventeen when she had married him.", "Nothing had prepared her for what became his callous indifference or \u2013 if she ever dared complain \u2013 his casual and vicious brutality.", "She turned away, feeling sick and a little giddy.", "It was barely six hours since the assassin had struck.", "The whole scene was raw and vivid in her mind: the murderer\u2019s eyes \u2013 pale blue like a Persian cat\u2019s \u2013 as he had stood over the bed, the silver flash of his blade, the warm red blood spurting from the cut in Sher Afghan\u2019s throat over her naked flesh, the utter astonishment on her husband\u2019s face in that moment just before life left him.", "Everything had happened so fast that she\u2019d had no time to feel afraid, but now the thought that the killer might well have turned his bloodied dagger on her was making her shake.", "He hadn\u2019t scrupled to kill the young watchman .", ".", ".", "Soldiers were already ransacking the town for the murderer.", "Her description had been enough to confirm that whoever he was, he was a foreigner.", "There had already been reports of a blue-eyed man \u2013 a Portuguese, some said \u2013 who had been staying in one of the caravanserais but now seemed to have vanished .", ".", ".", "Wrapping her arms around herself to feel warmer even though it was a summer\u2019s day, Mehrunissa turned her back on her husband\u2019s corpse and began to pace as she liked to do when she wished to think.", "Who the murderer was mattered less to her than his motive.", "Had the killing been the prelude to some wider rising?", "Might Gaur itself soon come under attack?", "If so, her own life and that of her daughter might yet be in danger.", "Or had Sher Afghan\u2019s murder been the result of some personal grudge?", "Her husband had made plenty of enemies.", "He had boasted to her about how he had embezzled imperial money as well as extorted higher taxes than authorised to enrich himself.", "He had also told her he had taken bribes from bandit chiefs to the north of Gaur in return for not suppressing their activities, and she knew that just before the start of the last monsoon rains, in response to pressure from the authorities in Agra to whom some wealthy merchants had complained, he had gone back on his word, pursuing the bandits relentlessly and cementing the heads of those he killed into towers as a warning.", "Many a man would be glad Sher Afghan was dead, but who would have dared to kill him in his own bedchamber?", "Hearing voices outside \u2013 perhaps the coffin makers coming to measure the body \u2013 Mehrunissa hastily put such thoughts aside.", "In the hours and days ahead she must watch for any threat to herself and her daughter but now she had her part to play as a grieving widow.", "It was a matter of family honour.", "She would scrupulously observe the mourning rituals and no one would suspect that in her heart she felt no sorrow, only release.", "A travel-stained, dusty-haired Bartholomew Hawkins was shown into Jahangir\u2019s private apartments.", "Though it was approaching midnight, learning of the Englishman\u2019s return Jahangir had been impatient for his news.", "\u2018Well?\u2019\n\n\u2018Majesty, it is done.", "I slit his throat with my own hands.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did anyone see you?\u2019\n\n\u2018Only the woman he was with.\u2019\n\nJahangir stared at him, face suddenly aghast.", "\u2018You didn\u2019t harm her?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, Majesty.\u2019\n\n\u2018You are absolutely certain?\u2019\n\n\u2018I swear it on my life.\u2019\n\nJahangir could see the puzzlement on Bartholomew\u2019s face.", "Clearly the man wasn\u2019t lying.", "He began to breathe more easily.", "\u2018You\u2019ve done well.", "One of my qorchis will bring you your money in the morning .", ".", ".\u2019 He paused as an idea came to him.", "\u2018What do you intend to do now?", "Return to your own land?\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not sure, Majesty.\u2019\n\n\u2018If you stay at my court I will find you further tasks.", "If you serve me as well as you have already, I will make you rich enough to purchase your own ship to take you home.\u2019 For all his tiredness Bartholomew Hawkins\u2019s eyes were suddenly agleam in his sunburned face.", "People were not so hard to understand as he had once believed, Jahangir thought.", "Despite all the cushions and the fur rugs to protect against the cold, the bullock cart carrying Mehrunissa up through the Khyber Pass towards Kabul was uncomfortable.", "She\u2019d be glad when the long journey from Bengal was ended.", "Her daughter Ladli was sleeping, head resting in the lap of Farisha, her Persian nurse, who had tended her since birth.", "The child had enjoyed the river journey westward along the Ganges and then northwards up the Jumna, but since they had disembarked near Delhi to travel the last six hundred miles overland she had grown fretful.", "The interior of the bullock cart, enclosed by thick curtains, was stuffy and dark.", "At almost six years old Ladli was still too young to understand that the curtains must be drawn to preserve them from the common view.", "The only time of day she enjoyed was when camp was pitched and she could run around the area separated off for the women by high wooden screens.", "But at least they were making good progress.", "They should be beyond the passes before the first snows fell.", "Winter in Kabul was harsh.", "Mehrunissa could recall the icicles thick as a man\u2019s arm hanging from the eaves of her father\u2019s house and how little moved beyond the city walls except the occasional hungry wolf patrolling the white expanses in search of a meal.", "Yet there had been many times in the hot, humid air of Bengal when she\u2019d longed to feel the chill wind on her cheek and to breathe out spirals of frosty air.", "Sher Afghan\u2019s murderer had still not been found by the time she left Gaur and there had been no clues to the motive behind the killing.", "To her relief everything had remained peaceful, but all the same she was glad Gaur now lay far behind.", "She had expected her father to make the arrangements for her long journey, and had therefore been surprised to receive his letter informing her that imperial troops from the fort at Monghyr, west of Gaur along the Ganges, would accompany her all the way to Kabul.", "The emperor grieves for you in your sad situation.", "He wishes you to return swiftly and in safety to your family, her father had written.", "The emperor is good to us beyond anything I could have expected.", "Bless you, daughter.", "The letter had been signed Ghiyas Beg and fastened with the great seal of the Treasurer of Kabul.", "During the long journey, Mehrunissa had often pondered her father\u2019s words.", "Presumably the emperor\u2019s generosity to her family stemmed from those months he had spent in Kabul when his father, the Emperor Akbar, had exiled him there.", "According to rumours circulating even before the prince\u2019s arrival, Jahangir had greatly angered Akbar.", "The wife of Saif Khan, the Governor of Kabul, had explained to Mehrunissa\u2019s mother what had really happened \u2013 the prince had been caught with one of his father\u2019s concubines.", "His punishment had been banishment but the woman\u2019s had been death .", ".", ".", "The prince had become a frequent visitor to her father\u2019s house.", "She could still recall the preparations when messengers brought word that he was on his way from the citadel \u2013 how her mother would order precious incense to be set alight in the burners, how her father would don his best robes and hurry to the entrance ready to greet him.", "Above all she could remember the night her father \u2013 who had given her no hint of what he intended \u2013 had summoned her to perform one of the classical dances of Persia for his guest.", "As her attendants brushed out and perfumed her hair she\u2019d felt nervous but also excited.", "She had performed the dance of the golden tree, the tiny golden bells in her fluttering hands symbolising the falling of its gilded leaves in autumn to lie on the forest floor, ruffled by the chill breezes of the coming winter.", "She had been so intent on getting the movements right \u2013 it was an intricate dance that she had spent many hours with her instructor trying to perfect \u2013 that at first she hadn\u2019t looked directly at the prince.", "When, confidence growing as the spirit of the dance began to possess her, she had raised her eyes to his, she had felt the intensity of his gaze.", "For some reason she hadn\u2019t understood at the time and now, after so many years, was even further from understanding, she had allowed her veil to slip.", "For three or four moments \u2013 no more \u2013 she had let him see her face and knew that it had pleased him.", "Not long after, Akbar had ordered his son to return to Agra.", "By then her head had been filled with thoughts of her approaching marriage to Sher Afghan.", "It had been a good match for the daughter of a Persian nobleman who had come penniless to the Moghul court.", "Even though her father had grown rich enough in the service of the emperor, and through trading ventures with merchants passing through Kabul, to give his daughter a large dowry \u2013 ten thousand gold mohurs \u2013 he had no lands, no great estates.", "Sher Afghan on the other hand belonged to the old Moghul nobility \u2013 his great-grandfather had ridden with Babur, the first Moghul emperor, on his conquest of Hindustan.", "In her preparations for her coming marriage she\u2019d pushed the prince \u2013 or the emperor as he now was \u2013 to the back of her mind: a sweet fantasy of what might have been.", "The cart gave a great judder.", "One of the front wheels must have hit a boulder, Mehrunissa thought.", "She would be heartily glad when this journey came to an end.", "Mehrunissa laid aside the volume of poems by the Persian Firduz that her father had purchased for her from a merchant recently arrived from Tabriz, got up and stretched.", "Feeling the need for some activity, she climbed up to the flat roof of her father\u2019s house, enjoying the warmth of the shallow stone steps beneath her bare hennaed feet.", "Stepping on to the roof, she looked northwards.", "There against a backdrop of snow-dusted mountains was the forbidding citadel, perched on a barren crag overlooking the city.", "She had thought of it often during her time in Gaur \u2013 how the tiny apertures in its strong walls resembled eyes keeping watch over Kabul.", "Although it was the governor\u2019s residence, her father had told her it was far from luxurious \u2013 a draughty stronghold built even before the time of Babur, who had launched his invasion of Hindustan from there.", "All the same she wished she could see inside a place where such grand ambitions had been nurtured.", "What must it have been like to see the Moghul army stream out of the citadel and away across the plains on a war of conquest that would change the lives of millions of people?", "What must it have been like for Babur to see his ambitions become reality?", "And could she ever really understand?", "If she\u2019d been born a man like her elder brother Asaf Khan, now an officer in the imperial army and on campaign over a thousand miles away to the south in the Deccan, or her younger brother Mir Khan, serving in the imperial garrison at Gwalior where the emperor\u2019s son Prince Khusrau was confined, she would have seen so much more of the world, understood so much more .", ".", ".", "Perhaps too her father would never have abandoned her to die straight after her birth on his perilous journey from Persia to Agra, however reluctant he had been to do so and however pleased he had been when fate and a friendly merchant had allowed him to recover her.", "The thought that expediency had overcome his love for her \u2013 and she knew both her parents loved her \u2013 was something that had remained with her.", "Together with her experiences in Bengal it had left her, she knew, with a cynical attitude to people and their motives.", "In a crisis the thoughts of few extended far beyond themselves.", "Besides, a woman\u2019s life, her life, was anyway so confined, whether here in her parents\u2019 house or later in Sher Afghan\u2019s haram in Gaur.", "Ever since she began to grow up she\u2019d felt curious about so much .", ".", ".", "about her family\u2019s homeland of Persia to the west and how the shah ruled that empire; whether the domes and minarets of Samarkand to the northeast really sparkled blue, green and gold as she\u2019d heard tell.", "Her father \u2013 when she could prise him from his ledgers \u2013 tried to answer her questions but there was so much more she wanted to know.", "Reading helped quell her frustration.", "In Gaur the few manuscript volumes she had acquired had made life with Sher Afghan more bearable after the first disillusionment had set in.", "Yet at the same time they had fed her restlessness, her dissatisfaction.", "Everything \u2013 the accounts of travellers, even poems \u2013 stimulated her already vivid imagination, suggesting life was laden with possibilities far beyond loveless couplings in the commander\u2019s haram in Gaur or the domestic pleasantness of her parents\u2019 home.", "Suddenly she heard a commotion in the square below.", "Walking swiftly across to the red and orange cotton screen that shielded the area of the roof bordering the square from passers-by, Mehrunissa peered down.", "A line of mounted imperial soldiers led by an officer and a banner-bearer was entering the square.", "As the soldiers dismounted her father\u2019s grooms hurried outside to take the reins and moments later the tall, thin figure of Ghiyas Beg himself appeared.", "Briefly inclining his head and touching his breast with his right hand, he led the officer inside.", "What did they want?", "she wondered.", "The other soldiers began strolling around the square, talking and laughing and nibbling walnuts they had bought from the old vendor \u2013 his features as wrinkled as the nuts he sold \u2013 who habitually sat there.", "But however much she strained she couldn\u2019t catch their words.", "As time passed and the officer remained with her father, Mehrunissa descended again to the women\u2019s courtyard, sat down on her stool and picked up her book once more.", "The shadows were lengthening and two attendants were lighting oil lamps when Mehrunissa heard her father\u2019s voice.", "Glancing up, she saw he looked agitated.", "\u2018What is it, Father?\u2019\n\nHe gestured to the attendants to withdraw then squatted beside her, long fingers twisting the gold-set amethyst ring that for as long as she could remember he had worn on the third finger of his left hand.", "She had never seen her father \u2013 normally so calm and controlled \u2013 like this.", "He hesitated briefly, then began in a voice that was not quite steady.", "\u2018Do you remember the letter I wrote to you in Gaur?", "That I was surprised by the emperor\u2019s goodness in sending imperial soldiers to escort you home .", ".", ".", "?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\u2018I was not being entirely frank with you .", ".", ".", "I did have an idea what the emperor\u2019s motive might be.\u2019\n\n\u2018What do you mean?\u2019\n\n\u2018Some years ago something happened here in Kabul \u2013 something to do with you.", "I never told you because I thought it better you shouldn\u2019t know.", "Had events turned out differently I alone would have taken the knowledge of it to my grave .", ".", ".", "When the emperor was still a prince, banished here to Kabul, he and I found much to discuss.", "Though I was only his father\u2019s treasurer, I think he appreciated me as an educated man \u2013 even came to regard me as a friend.", "That was why one night I asked you, as my only daughter, to dance for him.", "My single thought was to pay him the greatest compliment within my power.", "But soon afterwards \u2013 perhaps even the next day, I\u2019m not sure \u2013 he came to see me .", ".", ".", "Do you know what he wanted?\u2019 Ghiyas Beg\u2019s look was penetrating.", "\u2018No.\u2019\n\n\u2018He asked for you as his wife.\u2019\n\nMehrunissa stood up so abruptly that her stool toppled sideways.", "\u2018He wanted to marry me .", ".", ".", "?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes.", "But I had to tell him you were already betrothed to Sher Afghan \u2013 that I could not in all honour break that contract .", ".", ".\u2019\n\nMehrunissa began to pace the courtyard, hands clasped.", "Her father had refused Jahangir .", ".", ".", "Instead of being the wife of the cold, brutish Sher Afghan in the fetid heat of Bengal she could have been a prince\u2019s wife at the Moghul court, close to the heart of everything that mattered.", "Why?", "How could he?", "What could have motivated him to cut her off from so much?", "He would have benefited, as too would all the family .", ".", ".", "\u2018You are angry with me and perhaps you are right to be.", "I know your marriage to Sher Afghan was unhappy, but I couldn\u2019t have predicted that.", "I felt I had no choice except to act as I did.", "After all, the prince had been exiled by his father.", "He would have needed his father\u2019s permission to marry you and was unlikely to obtain it.", "At that time he was as likely to have been executed as to become emperor.", "To be associated with him by the emperor would not have been good for our family.\u2019 Ghiyas Beg paused.", "To Mehrunissa there seemed something self-contradictory in her father\u2019s torrent of exculpation.", "Had her father refused Jahangir for honour or for expediency?", "But he was continuing.", "\u2018Listen to what else I have to tell you and then perhaps you won\u2019t judge me so harshly.", "The emperor has appointed me his Comptroller of Revenues and ordered me to Agra.\u2019 Her father\u2019s eyes were suddenly full of tears \u2013 something Mehrunissa had never seen before.", "\u2018For the past twenty years and more \u2013 ever since we first came here \u2013 I\u2019ve thought about the moment when my qualities would be recognised and I would be given some great appointment.", "I had given up hope and schooled myself to be content .", ".", ".", "But there is still more.", "The emperor writes that you are to be lady-in-waiting to one of the Emperor Akbar\u2019s widows in the imperial haram.", "Daughter, I believe he has not forgotten you.", "Now that you are a widow and he is an emperor, he is free to do what he could not when he was only a prince and you were pledged to another man.\u2019\n\n\n\nSix days later, Mehrunissa lay back in her palanquin as the eight Gilzai tribesmen on whose broad shoulders the palanquin\u2019s bamboo poles were resting carried her and her sleeping daughter Ladli swiftly down through the narrow rock-strewn Khoord pass on the first stage of the descent to the plains of Hindustan.", "The pink brocade curtains enclosing her fluttered in the breeze allowing her glimpses of the steep, scree-covered slopes dotted with holly oak bushes.", "The bearers were keeping up an even rhythm, singing as they half ran.", "She hoped her father was right about Jahangir\u2019s intentions.", "She wanted him to be but as she knew from experience men could be changeable.", "Sher Afghan had been an attentive husband, a tender lover in the first months of their marriage until he grew tired of her .", ".", ".", "Also she might no longer please Jahangir.", "Men liked young flesh.", "Then she had been a girl of sixteen; now she was a woman of twenty-four.", "The crackle of musket fire and urgent cries of alarm from the back of the column broke into her thoughts.", "The palanquin began swaying violently as her bearers stopped singing and picked up speed.", "Putting a protective arm around Ladli she lifted a corner of one of the curtains and peered out but could see nothing but grey rocks and scree.", "All the time the yells and sounds of musketry grew louder and nearer.", "Then a rider galloped by from the rear of the column, so close that she could smell the sweat of his horse and the dust raised by its hooves stung her eyes and made her cough.", "He was shouting, \u2018Dacoits are attacking the baggage train!", "Three men and two baggage camels are down.", "Get more troops back there quickly!\u2019\n\nRubbing the dust from her eyes Mehrunissa looked back but a sharp bend in the track hid the baggage train from her view.", "These passes were notorious for the wild Afridi tribes who preyed on small groups of travellers, but to attack a party protected by an escort of imperial troops was surely reckless.", "They couldn\u2019t know who they were taking on .", ".", ".", "or maybe they did.", "Perhaps the news that the wealthy Treasurer of Kabul was on the road had tempted them.", "The shadows were lengthening.", "In an hour or two the sun would disappear below the peaks of the surrounding hills.", "Perhaps the attack on the baggage wagons in the rear was intended to hurry them deeper into the narrow Khoord Pass where a bigger ambush awaited in the dusk?", "The thought of the danger to herself and Ladli \u2013 and to her parents, travelling ahead of her in the column \u2013 chilled her for a moment, then she began to think.", "How would she defend herself and her daughter?", "She had no weapons.", "Ladli had awoken and she pulled the child closer to her.", "Sensing her mother\u2019s tension Ladli started to whimper.", "\u2018Hush,\u2019 Mehrunissa said, keeping her voice bright.", "\u2018Everything will be all right.", "Besides, crying never helped anyone.\u2019\n\nJust then someone shouted an order to halt.", "Her bearers stopped so abruptly that Mehrunissa tumbled forward.", "She lost her grip on Ladli and banged her forehead on one of the curved bamboo hoops that formed the frame of the palanquin so hard that for a moment she was dazed.", "Collecting herself, she pushed Ladli to the floor of the palanquin.", "\u2018Stay there!\u2019 Next she craned her head right out of the curtains to see that ahead of her the entire column had stopped.", "Musketmen were dismounting and, weapons slung across their backs, were scrambling up the scree-covered slopes, dislodging grit and pebbles as they did so, towards some tumbled rocks that would provide them with cover.", "Then a detachment of imperial horsemen swept past her palanquin heading towards the rear of the column where the sounds of fighting were intensifying.", "The track was so narrow that they had to drop into single file as they passed her.", "The last of them was a young officer mounted on a black horse, face anxious and sword already drawn.", "Should she break purdah and run with Ladli to her parents\u2019 cart, Mehrunissa wondered, but then dismissed the idea.", "It would only expose them both to any marksmen in the rocks above.", "There was no point in making any move until the progress of the fighting was clearer.", "Instead she closed the curtains around the palanquin again.", "Time passed slowly in the semi-darkness.", "Conscious all the time of the sounds of muskets \u2013 sometimes seeming nearer, sometimes further away \u2013 and of curt shouted orders for soldiers to advance or fall back, as well as of the pain in her forehead, on which a large bump was now rising, she forced herself to sing Persian folk songs to Ladli.", "At last the cries and shooting from the back of the column subsided, but what did that mean?", "Then she heard approaching hoofbeats, victorious whoops and answering cheers from bearers and soldiers near her palanquin.", "The raiders must have been beaten off .", ".", ".", "Looking out once more she watched the victorious imperial soldiers returning.", "Several, including the young officer she had seen, had the heads of those they had slain dangling by their hair from the pommels of their saddles, blood dripping from their roughly severed necks.", "But it was the last rider who caught her attention as he approached.", "He was oddly dressed in a short tight-fitting leather jacket and on his head, instead of a pointed Moghul helmet with a fringe of chain mail to protect the neck, was a plain round one.", "As he drew abreast of her, he turned his head.", "A pair of pale, cat-like blue eyes looked directly at her.", "Chapter 4\n\nThe Imperial Haram\n\n\u2018Madam, it is time.", "My name is Mala.", "I am His Imperial Majesty\u2019s khawajasara, his superintendent of the imperial haram, and have come to escort you to the apartments of Fatima Begam whom you will serve.\u2019 Mala was a tall, stately looking woman in late middle age.", "Her long ivory staff of office carved at the top in the shape of a lotus flower added to her dignity.", "Mehrunissa sensed a formidable personality behind the smile.", "She returned her gaze to her parents, standing side by side in the courtyard of the spacious apartments within the walls of the Agra fort allocated to Ghiyas Beg\u2019s household.", "Her mother was holding Ladli by the hand.", "Mehrunissa knelt and kissed her daughter.", "She had looked forward to this moment with enormous anticipation but now that it had come, three weeks after reaching Agra, she felt apprehensive, even reluctant.", "Parting from the child who had been such a consolation to her was hard, even though Ladli would be in the care of her grandparents and nursemaid Farisha and would be allowed to visit her in the haram.", "Conscious that the khawajasara was watching, Mehrunissa forced herself to suppress her feelings, something her life with Sher Afghan had taught her to do well, and to keep a calm face.", "Giving Ladli one final hug she rose, turned to her parents and embraced them also.", "As she stepped back from them, Ghiyas Beg\u2019s face was full of pride.", "\u2018Our thoughts will be with you.", "Serve your mistress well,\u2019 he said.", "Mehrunissa followed the khawajasara out of the courtyard and down a sandstone staircase that gave on to the steep ramp leading into the heart of the Agra fort.", "A few yards away six female attendants dressed in green waited beside a silk-decked palanquin.", "They looked tall and broad.", "She had already heard about the muscular Turkish women who helped guard the haram, but as she drew closer she gasped to see that the attendants were not women but eunuchs with large hands and feet and strangely smooth faces, neither masculine nor feminine.", "All were wearing rich jewellery and the eyes of several were rimmed with kohl.", "She had seen eunuchs before, employed as servants or dancing and playing for crowds in the bazaar, but never dressed as parodies of women like this.", "\u2018Madam, the palanquin is for you,\u2019 said the khawajasara.", "Mehrunissa stepped inside and sat cross-legged on the low seat.", "Hands twitched the silk curtains into place around her and the palanquin rose as the eunuchs lifted it on to their shoulders.", "As it began its slow swaying progress up the ramp, carrying her to a new life, she found she was clasping her hands and her heart was beating so fast that her blood seemed to pound in her ears.", "So much had happened in such a short time .", ".", ".", "In the shadowy half-light she tried to recapture Jahangir\u2019s lean, handsome face, the way he had looked at her as she had danced for him in Kabul .", ".", ".", "Was he really to be her future as her father claimed and she so desired?", "Soon she would know.", "\u2018What do you wish to tell me, Majesty?", "I came from Fatehpur Sikri as soon as I received your summons.\u2019 The Sufi\u2019s voice was gentle but his gaze was penetrating.", "Now that the moment had come, Jahangir felt reluctant to speak.", "The Sufi, whom out of respect to his status as a holy man he had invited to sit on a stool close by his own in his private apartments, seemed to sense his awkwardness and continued, \u2018I know that when you were only a boy you opened your heart to my father.", "I don\u2019t presume to have either my father\u2019s powers of prophesy or his insight, but if you will trust me I will try to help you.\u2019\n\nJahangir thought back to that warm night in Fatehpur Sikri when he had run from the palace to the house of Shaikh Salim Chishti hoping to find answers.", "\u2018Your father was a great man.", "He told me not to despair, that I would be emperor.", "His words sustained me through many difficult times as I grew to manhood.\u2019\n\n\u2018Perhaps my words can also give you solace.\u2019\n\nJahangir looked at the Sufi \u2013 a much bigger man than his frail-looking father had been.", "He was as tall as Jahangir and well muscled as a soldier, but physical strength wouldn\u2019t make him any more forgiving of moral weakness, Jahangir thought .", ".", ".", "He took a breath and began, choosing his words with care.", "\u2018When my father exiled me to Kabul I saw a woman there, the daughter of one of my father\u2019s officials.", "I knew instinctively that she was the woman I had been seeking.", "Though I already had several wives I was certain beyond any doubt that she would be my soulmate \u2013 that I must marry her.", "But there was a problem.", "She was already promised to one of my father\u2019s commanders and though I begged my father he refused to break their betrothal.\u2019\n\n\u2018The Emperor Akbar was a just man, Majesty.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, but not always where members of his own family were concerned.", "He refused to accept how important this woman was to me.", "He wouldn\u2019t understand that I felt as my grandfather Humayun must have done when he saw his wife Hamida for the first time.", "He broke with his brother Hindal, who also loved Hamida, in order to have her.", "He even hazarded his empire because of his love for her.", "Some might say he was foolish .", ".", ".\u2019 Jahangir glanced at the Sufi sitting silent by his side, hands resting on his knees and

convenience.\u2019\n\n\u2018Sher Afghan was corrupt.", "The commander I appointed in his place has provided me with ample evidence of how much imperial money he stole.", "Thousands of mohurs sent him from my treasury for the purchase of horses and equipment went into his own pocket.", "He also had wealthy merchants executed on false charges so that he could seize their property.", "I have enough evidence to have had Sher Afghan executed ten, twenty times .", ".", ".\u2019\n\n\u2018But you knew nothing about his crimes when you ordered his death?\u2019\n\nJahangir hesitated, then said,

desires and wait.", "You must not bed her for least six months and in the meantime you must pray daily to God to forgive you.\u2019 So saying, the Sufi rose and without waiting for Jahangir to dismiss him walked from the apartments.", "Fatima Begam\u2019s broad face was lined and dry as parchment and a large mole on the left side of her chin sprouted a trio of luxuriant white hairs.", "Could she ever have been beautiful \u2013 beautiful enough to have made Akbar eager to make her his wife?", "Mehrunissa wondered, watching the elderly woman lying dozing on a low bed piled with plump orange cushions.", "She thought she could guess the answer.", "Though he had chosen his concubines for his physical pleasure, Akbar had used marriage as a means of contracting political alliances.", "Fatima Begam\u2019s family were rulers of a small state on the borders of Sind.", "Mehrunissa stirred restlessly.", "She wished she could read but Fatima Begam liked the lighting in her apartments to be kept

sweeping by.", "A group of men were cantering along its broad muddy bank, their hunting dogs running behind.", "Once again she envied men their freedom.", "Here in the imperial haram, this self-contained city of women, her life felt even more constricted than it had in Kabul.", "Despite the beauty of its flower-filled gardens and terraces, its avenues of trees and shimmering scented fountains, the rich furnishings \u2013 no floor was ever left bare, and colourful swathes of glowing silks and sensuous velvets draped windows and doors \u2013 the haram seemed like a prison.", "Rajput soldiers guarded the great gates leading into it and within it was patrolled by female guards and by the bland-faced but knowing-looking eunuchs whose presence, even after eight weeks, she still found unsettling.", "Yet most unsettling of all was that as yet she had heard nothing from the emperor .", ".", ".", "she hadn\u2019t even caught a glimpse of him though she knew he was at court.", "Why hadn\u2019t he sent for her or even come to visit Fatima Begam where he would know he would be sure of seeing her?", "Could it be that her hopes \u2013 and those of her father \u2013 had no foundation after all?", "She must be patient, Mehrunissa told herself as she turned away from the window.", "What else could she do?", "If she was to prosper here instinct told her she needed to understand this strange new world.", "She must explore the haram whenever Fatima Begam had errands for her.", "She had already discovered that the honeycomb of rooms built around three sides of a square paved courtyard where Fatima Begam had her quarters housed dozens of women related one way or another to the imperial family \u2013 aunts, great-aunts, the most distant of distant cousins.", "She had also seen enough to know that her estimation of Mala\u2019s importance and character had been correct.", "The khawajasara rigidly controlled every aspect of the haram from the preparation of perfumes and cosmetics to checking the accounts, purchasing the stores and monitoring the kitchens.", "The officious but efficient Mala knew the names of every one of her small army of assistants and servants down to the female scavengers employed to clean the underground tunnels into which the latrines emptied.", "It was she who gave permission for female visitors to enter the haram.", "It was also the khawajasara\u2019s job \u2013 so Mehrunissa had heard \u2013 to keep a detailed account of every woman the emperor made love to, including his wives, and the date in case a child was conceived.", "Watching through a tiny screen set high in the walls of each chamber for just such a purpose, she even noted the number of couplings.", "Jahangir\u2019s wives, so Mehrunissa had learned, lived in grand quarters in a separate part of the haram she had not yet seen.", "If only her father had agreed to Jahangir\u2019s request all those years ago, she might have been one of them.", "What kind of women were they and did he still visit their beds?", "It was difficult for her, a newcomer, to ask directly but gossip was one of the haram\u2019s main pastimes and conversation was easy to steer in the direction she wished.", "She had already heard that Jodh Bai, mother of Prince Khurram, was a humorous good-natured woman and that the Persian-born mother of Prince Parvez had grown very fat through eating the sweetmeats for which she had a passion but was still so vain that she spent hours studying her face in one of the tiny pearl-rimmed mirrors mounted on thumb rings that were so fashionable.", "She had also learned that since Prince Khusrau\u2019s rebellion, his mother Man Bai had kept to her apartments, spending her time alternately condemning Khusrau and accusing others of leading her son astray.", "According to the gossip Man Bai had always been highly strung.", "It was sad to think of a woman whose love must be torn between husband and son, but Man Bai should show more strength .", ".", ".", "Mehrunissa was still so deep in her thoughts that she started as the doors opened and Fatima Begam\u2019s niece Sultana, a widow in her early forties, bustled in.",

about a cargo of indigo to discuss.\u2019 Sultana\u2019s tone was cool and her expression unfriendly as she turned to leave.", "Mehrunissa had grown used to the coldness, even hostility, of some of the inmates of the haram, and to their curiosity.", "She had overheard two elderly women speculating why the widow of the murdered Sher Afghan should have been made a lady-in-waiting.", "\u2018She\u2019s young and good looking enough.", "What is she doing here?", "You\u2019d have thought they\u2019d have married her off again,\u2019 one had said.", "It was a good question.", "What was she doing here?", "Mehrunissa wondered.", "On the opposite side of the chamber, Fatima Begam shifted position a little and started to snore.", "\u2018The khawajasara has ordered everyone to the courtyard immediately,\u2019 one of Fatima Begam\u2019s maids, a thin, wiry little woman called Nadya, said.", "\u2018Even you must come, madam,\u2019 she added, bowing her head respectfully to her elderly mistress.", "\u2018Why?", "What has happened?\u2019 Fatima Begam didn\u2019t look best pleased at having her early evening meal disrupted, Mehrunissa thought.", "\u2018A concubine has been caught with one of the eunuchs.", "Some say he was more of a man than he pretended, others that they were just kissing.", "She is to be flogged.\u2019\n\n\u2018When I was young such a crime would have meant death.\u2019 Fatima Begam\u2019s normally mild face was disapproving.", "\u2018What about the eunuch?\u2019\n\n\u2018He has already been taken down to the parade ground to die under the elephant\u2019s foot.\u2019\n\n\u2018Good,\u2019 said Fatima Begam.", "\u2018That is as it should be.\u2019\n\nFollowing Fatima Begam, Mehrunissa saw that the courtyard was already packed with chattering women, some looking apprehensive while others were curious and trying to manoeuvre for a better view of the centre of the courtyard where five female haram guards were erecting a wooden frame like a small gallows.", "\u2018Stand behind me,\u2019 Fatima Begam ordered Mehrunissa, \u2018and hold my handkerchief and scent bottle.\u2019\n\nOne of the guards was now pushing with her strong bare arms against the punishment frame, testing its strength.", "She stepped back and nodded to another guard who put a short bronze horn to her lips and blew a shrill metallic blast.", "At the sound Mehrunissa saw the khawajasara, clad entirely in scarlet and walking with her customary slow, dignified pace, enter the courtyard from the right, the women parting to allow her through.", "Behind Mala, dragged along by two more female guards, was a plump young woman whose eyes were already streaming with tears and whose abject posture showed that she knew there would be no mercy.", "As the khawajasara approached the wooden frame she said, \u2018Strip her.", "Let the flogging begin.\u2019\n\nThe guards who had been holding the woman pushed her forward on to her knees and roughly pulled off her silk bodice and long, full muslin trousers, tearing the delicate fabric and sending pearls from the tasselled fastenings rolling across the courtyard.", "One came to rest against Mehrunissa\u2019s foot.", "As the guards dragged her naked to the frame the woman began screaming, her body bucking and straining and her full breasts swaying as she struggled, but she was no match for their muscular strength and they had soon bound her ankles to the bottom corners of the frame and her wrists to the upper corners with hide thongs.", "The woman\u2019s hair was very long, falling to well beneath her buttocks.", "Drawing her dagger, one of the guards hacked it off just beneath the nape of her neck and let the shining mass fall in a coil to the ground.", "All around her, Mehrunissa caught a collective gasp.", "For a woman to forfeit her hair \u2013 one of her greatest beauties \u2013 was in itself a terrible, shaming thing.", "Two of the female guards now stepped forward, stripped off their outer tunics and from the broad, studded leather belts round their waists pulled out short-handled whips with knotted cords.", "Taking their place on either side of the frame they raised their arms and began, first one, then the other, to lash the prisoner\u2019s already trembling, quivering body.", "At each blow they called out the number \u2013 \u2018one\u2019, \u2018two\u2019, \u2018three\u2019 \u2013 and each time the hissing cords bit into her soft smooth flesh the woman screamed out until her cries became one continuous almost animal shriek.", "Desperately but futilely she tried to twist her body out of reach of the whips.", "Blood was soon running down her back and spine and between her buttocks and speckling the paving stones beneath her.", "All around her Mehrunissa realised the courtyard had fallen silent.", "\u2018Nineteen\u2019, \u2018twenty\u2019 called out the guards, their own bodies now glistening with a sheen of sweat.", "By the fifteenth blow the limp, bleeding figure dangling from the frame had ceased its terrible screaming and looked unconscious.", "\u2018Enough,\u2019 said the khawajasara.", "\u2018Take her naked as she is and throw her out into the streets.", "She will find her natural place in the whorehouses of the bazaar.\u2019 Then holding her staff of office out in front of her she made her way from the courtyard as a babble of voices broke out behind her.", "Mehrunissa was trembling and she felt a little sick.", "She needed space and fresh air.", "Telling Fatima Begam that she felt unwell, she half ran to a fountain in the far corner of the swiftly emptying courtyard and sitting down on its marble rim splashed her face with water.", "\u2018Are you all right, madam?\u2019 She looked up to see Nadya.", "\u2018Yes.", "It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve never witnessed anything like that.", "I didn\u2019t know that punishments in the haram could be so brutal.\u2019\n\n\u2018She was lucky.", "Far more terrible things can happen than a flogging.", "Surely you\u2019ve heard the story of Anarkali?\u2019\n\nMehrunissa shook her head.", "\u2018She was bricked up alive in the dungeons of the imperial palace at Lahore.", "They say if you pass by at night you can still hear her sobbing to be let out.\u2019\n\n\u2018What had she done to deserve such a death?\u2019\n\n\u2018She was the Emperor Akbar\u2019s most prized concubine but took his son, our present emperor Jahangir, as her lover.\u2019\n\nMehrunissa stared at the maid.", "Anarkali must be the name of the concubine whose embraces had caused Jahangir\u2019s exile to Kabul.", "What a terrible price to pay for a few moments\u2019 human frailty .", ".", ".", "\u2018What actually happened, Nadya?\u2019\n\nThe maid\u2019s face lit up.", "It was clearly a tale she enjoyed telling.", "\u2018Akbar\u2019s passion for Anarkali was greater than for any other.", "She once told me that when they were alone he liked her to dance for him naked except for the jewels he gave her.", "One night at the time of the great Nauruz festival he gave a feast where he ordered Anarkali to perform before him and his nobles.", "Akbar\u2019s son Jahangir was one of the guests.", "He had never seen her before and her beauty so overcame him that he determined to have her even though she was his father\u2019s.", "He bribed the woman who was then the khawajasara to bring Anarkali to him when Akbar was away from court.\u2019\n\n\u2018And they were discovered?\u2019\n\n\u2018Not at first, no.", "But as Jahangir\u2019s lust for Anarkali grew, so also did his recklessness.", "The khawajasara became frightened and confessed everything to the emperor.", "Her reward was a quick rather than a slow death.", "Then the emperor ordered Anarkali and Jahangir to be brought before him.", "My uncle was one of Akbar\u2019s bodyguards and saw everything.", "He told me Anarkali pleaded for her life, her face wet with kohl-streaked tears, but Akbar was deaf and blind to her.", "Even when Jahangir shouted that he, not Anarkali, was to blame the emperor told him to be silent.", "He ordered Anarkali to be walled up and left to starve to death.", "\u2018As for the prince, my uncle said everyone was certain from the emperor\u2019s expression that Akbar was going to order his execution.", "As soon as Anarkali had been dragged away a deep silence fell on the assembled courtiers.", "But whatever his original intentions, however violent his rage, at the last moment Akbar could not bring himself to have his own son killed.", "Instead he exiled him with only his milk-brother for company.\u2019\n\nMehrunissa nodded.", "\u2018I know.", "He was sent to Kabul while my father was treasurer there.\u2019\n\n\u2018But that wasn\u2019t quite the end of Anarkali\u2019s story, at least I don\u2019t think it was .", ".", ".\u2019\n\n\u2018What do you mean?\u2019\n\n\u2018Within the haram it was whispered that Jahangir had persuaded his grandmother Hamida to ease Anarkali\u2019s suffering and that somehow before the last bricks of her prison were in place Hamida found a way to get a phial of poison to her so she could escape the torments of a long and agonising death.\u2019\n\nDespite the warm early evening air Mehrunissa shivered.", "First the flogging and now this horrible story.", "\u2018I should return to Fatima Begum,\u2019 she said.", "As she walked with Nadya across the courtyard, where the wooden frame had now been taken down and the blood washed from the paving stones, her head was still full of the tragedy of Anarkali.", "Had Akbar been a harsh and callous man?", "That wasn\u2019t how others spoke of him and was certainly not how her father remembered him.", "Ghiyas Beg had always praised the late emperor and the tolerance and justice with which he had governed.", "Perhaps in the heat of his anger Akbar had forgotten who he was and had lashed out as a man whose pride had been wounded rather than as an emperor who should be above inflicting such a vicious revenge on a weak woman with little power over her own destiny.", "Jahangir .", ".", ".", "surely he had been the most to blame?", "What did the story tell her about his character?", "That he could be reckless and impulsive and selfish but also that he was capable of great passion and had courage.", "He had tried to shield Anarkali and take the blame on himself.", "When that failed he had done what he could to save her from further suffering.", "Mehrunissa thought of his fine physique, the compelling look in his eyes that had prompted her to drop her veil as she danced for him.", "It was strange, but the story of his doomed desire for Anarkali hadn\u2019t diminished him in her eyes \u2013 almost the reverse.", "How exciting it could be to share life with a man like that, so full of virile energy and with so much power to wield.", "Yet almost at once other more sober thoughts began to intrude.", "Weren\u2019t there disturbing similarities between Anarkali\u2019s story and her own?", "Jahangir had seen Anarkali only once and that had been enough to convince him he must have her and he had been ruthless in his pursuit of her.", "He had also seen her, Mehrunissa, only once and not so many months after Anarkali\u2019s death and had wanted her as well.", "It wasn\u2019t quite the same, she tried to convince herself.", "Jahangir had openly and honourably asked her father for her hand.", "When her father refused him, he had accepted it.", "Or had he?", "Mehrunissa\u2019s brain was now working feverishly.", "Unbidden she saw before her once again the blue-eyed man riding past her during the descent through the passes from Kabul.", "At the time, she\u2019d asked Ladli\u2019s nursemaid Farisha, a notorious and accomplished gossip, to find out who he was.", "Just two days later she had reported triumphantly that there was indeed a foreign soldier with blue eyes among the bodyguard \u2013 an Englishman whom the emperor had recently appointed.", "At the time that information had persuaded Mehrunissa she had been mistaken.", "Sher Afghan\u2019s murderer was said to be Portuguese.", "Also, as she\u2019d continued to tell herself, these foreigners often looked alike and she\u2019d only seen her husband\u2019s assassin for a few moments in dim light and in terrifying circumstances.", "Yet in her heart she had not been satisfied.", "How could she forget the look in those pale eyes as he had drawn his dagger across her husband\u2019s throat or mistake them when she saw them again?", "But now Mehrunissa wondered whether she might be coming closer to the truth.", "Jahangir had wanted Anarkali and had allowed nothing to stand in his way.", "If he desired her, Mehrunissa, why should he be any less ruthless?", "For a second time Mehrunissa shivered but now it was for herself rather than for the dead concubine.", "It excited her physically to think that Jahangir wanted her so much, but Anarkali\u2019s fate showed that too intimate a contact with the imperial family could bring danger as well as reward .", ".", ".", "Chapter 5\n\nThe Meena Bazaar\n\nJahangir felt his opponent\u2019s curved sword grate on the steel mesh of the mail coat protecting his thigh before sliding off to cut deep into his gilded leather saddle.", "Pulling hard on the reins of his black horse he aimed a slashing sword cut at his enemy\u2019s arm as the man struggled to pull back his own weapon for another swing.", "However, he missed as the other rider reined in so hard that his grey horse reared up.", "One of the animal\u2019s flailing front hooves caught Jahangir\u2019s mount in the belly.", "The other struck Jahangir\u2019s upper calf.", "It was a glancing blow but it turned his lower leg numb and his foot slipped from its stirrup.", "As his horse swerved away whinnying in pain, Jahangir lost his balance but quickly recovered, steadied his mount and managed to get his foot back in the stirrup.", "Then the other man was upon him again.", "Jahangir ducked down on to the sweating neck of his black horse as his opponent\u2019s sword hissed through the air just above the plume on his helmet.", "Even if a rebel, the raja was a true warrior who had had the courage to pick him out in the charge, Jahangir just had time to think as he wheeled his horse again to face him.", "Both men dug their heels into their mounts\u2019 flanks and simultaneously charged forward.", "This time Jahangir aimed his stroke at his enemy\u2019s neck.", "First it caught the rim of a steel breastplate but then bit into flesh and sinew.", "At the same time Jahangir felt a stinging pain as the raja\u2019s curved sword sliced through his long leather gauntlet into his own sword arm and blood began to flow.", "Turning quickly, he saw his opponent slowly collapse sideways from his saddle and then hit the dusty ground with a thud which dislodged the sword from his right hand.", "Jahangir leapt from his saddle and half running, half limping because of his damaged calf propelled himself towards the fallen man.", "Although crimson blood was streaming from the wound in his neck into his thick, curly black beard and down on to his breastplate, he was still trying to struggle to his feet.", "\u2018Surrender,\u2019 Jahangir demanded.", "\u2018And end my life in your dungeons?", "Never.", "I will die here on the red earth that has been my family\u2019s for so many generations \u2013 so many more than yours have claimed our land.\u2019 As the words mingled with blood bubbling through his lips he used his remaining reserves of strength to pull a long serrated-bladed dagger from a scabbard inside his riding boot.", "Before he could even draw his arm back to make his thrust Jahangir\u2019s sword cut into his neck once more, this time just above his Adam\u2019s apple, almost severing his head from his torso.", "He fell back, his pumping blood crimsoning the dust.", "His body twitched once or twice and then he lay still.", "Jahangir stood over the lifeless corpse.", "His own blood was still running from the wound in his forearm down his hand into the fingers of his gauntlet where it was collecting, warm and sticky.", "Sensation was quickly returning to his calf but the sensation was pain.", "Pulling his face cloth from around his neck with his uninjured hand he dabbed roughly at the calf wound, where the flailing hoof had penetrated not only the skin but also the layer of creamy fat beneath, exposing the purple-red of his muscle.", "He could easily have been killed, losing his life and his throne before he had even begun to fulfil his ambitions.", "Why against all the advice of his counsellors had he decided to lead in person the campaign against the Raja of Mirzapur who now lay sprawled dead before him?", "Why had he himself led the charge against the raja\u2019s forces, outdistancing his bodyguard just as he had done in the battle against Khusrau?", "The raja had after all been no real threat to his throne, merely a recalcitrant vassal, the ruler of a small state on the borders of the Rajasthani desert who had refused to pay his annual tribute to the imperial treasury.", "Part of the answer was the one that he had repeated to his counsellors \u2013 to show that he would brook no defiance from any of his subordinates however mighty or humble and that he would rely on no one else to deal out punishments to rebels.", "However, he could admit to himself that there was an additional reason for leading the expedition in person.", "It was a distraction from his thoughts of Mehrunissa, removing him from Agra and the almost irresistible temptation to call her to him despite the Sufi\u2019s prohibition.", "Feeling suddenly faint from heat and loss of blood Jahangir called to his men for water.", "Then the world began to spin before him.", "A few minutes later he came back to consciousness to find himself lying on a blanket on the ground while two serious-faced hakims bent over him as they worked to staunch and bind his wounds beneath the desert sun.", "With returning consciousness came a sudden thought.", "Now the raja was dead and the campaign over he would be easily back in Agra in time for the New Year\u2019s celebrations.", "Surely they would provide an opportunity for him at least to meet Mehrunissa once more without breaking the Sufi\u2019s strictures to take no specific initiative to do so.", "Despite the sharp prick of pain as one of the hakims\u2019 needles went through the skin of his forearm, as the man began to stitch the two sides of his wound together Jahangir could not suppress a smile.", "\u2018Well, what do you think of the Agra fort?\u2019 Mehrunissa asked her niece as they sat in Ghiyas Beg\u2019s apartments.", "How beautiful Arjumand Banu was, she was thinking.", "She hadn\u2019t seen her since she was a young child in Kabul.", "She was fourteen now but had none of the clumsy awkwardness of many girls of her age.", "Her face was a delicate oval, the brows finely arched, and her thick dark hair fell almost to her waist.", "Her looks came from her Persian mother who had died when she was only four but her eyes, like her father\u2019s, Asaf Khan\u2019s, were black.", "\u2018I\u2019ve never seen anything like it \u2013 so many attendants, so many courtyards and fountains, so many jewels.", "As we entered the fort they beat drums in the gatehouse in my father\u2019s honour.\u2019 Arjumand was still sparkling with the novelty of it all.", "Mehrunissa smiled.", "How she wished she were that age again .", ".", ".", "\u2018Ever since Akbar\u2019s reign, the drums have been sounded to honour the arrival of a victorious commander.", "I was very proud to hear them as well.\u2019\n\nSome weeks previously Mehrunissa\u2019s father had written joyfully that her elder brother Asaf Khan had so distinguished himself while fighting away to the south in the Deccan that the emperor had summoned him to Agra to command the garrison here.", "Asaf Khan had reached the city two weeks ago.", "It had taken Mehrunissa this long to obtain leave first from Fatima Begam and then from the officious khawajasara to visit Ghiyas Beg\u2019s apartments and she was eager to see her brother.", "\u2018Where is your father?", "I\u2019ve only permission to remain here until sunset.\u2019\n\n\u2018He is with the emperor discussing plans for some new fortifications but he promised he would come as soon as he could.\u2019\n\nMehrunissa could hear her mother singing to Ladli in a room just off the courtyard.", "The child had adjusted quickly to her absence and though she knew she should be glad it still hurt a little to realise that her daughter didn\u2019t really miss her.", "Her family was thriving.", "Ghiyas Beg\u2019s duties as Imperial Treasurer were keeping him very busy, so her mother told her, while Asaf Khan was clearly high in Jahangir\u2019s favour.", "It was only she, Mehrunissa, who was the failure.", "She had still heard nothing from the emperor and the monotony of serving Fatima Begam was growing daily more irksome.", "\u2018What is it, Aunt?", "You look sad.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s nothing.", "I was just thinking what a very long time it\u2019s been since we were all together.\u2019\n\n\u2018And the emperor\u2019s women?", "His wives and concubines, what are they like?\u2019 Arjumand persisted.", "Mehrunissa shook her head.", "\u2018I haven\u2019t seen them.", "They live in a separate area of the haram where the emperor eats and sleeps.", "I live where the women, like my mistress, are nearly all old.\u2019\n\nArjumand looked disappointed.", "\u2018That\u2019s not how I imagined the imperial haram.\u2019\n\n\u2018Neither did I\u2014\u2019 At that moment Mehrunissa heard footsteps in the corridor, then Asaf Khan strode in.", "\u2018Sister!", "The attendants told me I would find you here.\u2019 Before she had quite risen from her seat he had enfolded her in his arms, almost lifting her from the floor.", "He was as tall as their father but broader and square jawed.", "He was smiling at her.", "\u2018You\u2019ve changed.", "You were just a girl when I last saw you \u2013 not much older than Arjumand, and a lot more gawky.", "But look at you now .", ".", ".\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s good to see you too, Asaf Khan.", "When I last saw you, you were only a young officer with spots and spindly legs,\u2019 she countered.", "\u2018Now you command the Agra garrison.\u2019\n\nAsaf Khan shrugged.", "\u2018The emperor has been good to me.", "I hope our brother is as fortunate.", "If I can I will get Mir Khan transferred here from Gwalior so that the family can really be together.", "It would please our parents, especially our mother .", ".", ".", "But more news.", "The emperor has invited our family to attend the Royal Meena Bazaar in the Agra fort next month.\u2019\n\n\u2018What is it?\u2019 Arjumand turned puzzled eyes on her father but Mehrunissa answered.", "\u2018The bazaar is part of the Nauruz \u2013 the eighteen-day New Year celebration the Emperor Akbar introduced to mark the sun entering into Aries.", "Fatima Begam is always complaining that two weeks before it starts all you can hear in the haram is the sound of workmen hammering and banging as they erect the pavilion in the fort\u2019s gardens.\u2019\n\n\u2018And the Royal Meena Bazaar?\u2019\n\n\u2018One of the festival\u2019s most important events.", "It\u2019s like a real bazaar except the only customers are royalty and nobility.", "It takes place at night in the fort gardens.", "The courtiers\u2019 wives and daughters \u2013 women like us \u2013 spread out trinkets and swathes of silk on tables and play the part of traders, bantering and bargaining with their would-be purchasers \u2013 royal matrons and princesses and, of course, the emperor and his sons.", "The festival is so intimate that all the women go unveiled.\u2019\n\n\u2018Father, I can go, can\u2019t I?\u2019 Arjumand was suddenly looking anxious.", "\u2018Of course.", "Now, I must leave you again.", "I\u2019ve more military business to attend to but I\u2019ll be back soon.\u2019\n\nAfter Asaf Khan had left, Mehrunissa sat with Arjumand Banu trying to answer the girl\u2019s eager questions.", "But her mind was elsewhere.", "Fatima Begam had told her all about the bazaar but she had not been approving and had said things Mehrunissa certainly couldn\u2019t tell her niece.", "\u2018The Meena Bazaar is a meat market \u2013 no more, no less.", "Akbar started it because he wanted a chance to select new bedfellows.", "If any unmarried woman caught his eye he would order the khawajasara to prepare her for his pleasure.\u2019 Looking at the frown on the old woman\u2019s usually genial face, Mehrunissa guessed that long ago something had happened at the bazaar to offend her.", "Perhaps she had resented Akbar\u2019s promiscuous sexual appetites.", "Deep down Mehrunissa felt as excited as Arjumand \u2013 the bazaar was one place she could be sure of seeing the emperor.", "But would Fatima Begam allow her to attend?", "As the evening candles were being lit in Fatima Begam\u2019s claustrophobic apartments a week later Mehrunissa had her answer.", "Ever since she\u2019d told her of the invitation the old lady had equivocated.", "Now, even though Mehrunissa had dressed herself in her finest clothes and put on her best jewels, Fatima Begam had assumed a stubborn expression Mehrunissa knew well.", "\u2018I have decided.", "You are a widow.", "It would not be seemly for you to attend the bazaar.", "And I am too old for such things.", "Read some Persian poetry to me instead.", "That will be pleasanter for us both than all that noise and vulgarity.\u2019\n\nBiting her lip, Mehrunissa picked up a volume of poems and with fingers trembling with frustration slowly undid the silver clasps on the rosewood covers.", "The great courtyard of the Agra fort had been transformed, thought Khurram as, to three trumpet bursts, he and his elder brother Parvez entered it behind their father Jahangir, all three dressed in cloth of gold.", "Candles burning in globes of coloured glass suspended from the branches of trees and bushes and from artificial trees of silver and gold cast moving jewel-bright shadows \u2013 red, blue, yellow, green \u2013 in the soft breeze.", "Around the walls he could see the velvet-draped stalls heaped with trinkets and the women waiting behind them.", "It looked as splendid as in his grandfather\u2019s time.", "He could vividly recall Akbar\u2019s pleasure in the whole Nauruz festival.", "\u2018Being wealthy is good \u2013 indeed it is a necessity.", "But showing that you are wealthy is even more important for a monarch.\u2019\n\nAkbar had understood the meaning of magnificence.", "Some of Khurram\u2019s earliest memories were of sitting by his grandfather\u2019s side in a glittering howdah as they rode through the streets of Agra.", "Akbar had always believed in showing himself to his people and they had loved him for it.", "Akbar had been like the sun and some of his radiance had fallen on himself, Khurram thought.", "Yet his father Jahangir who, sparkling with diamonds, was now moving among his nobles had been kept in the shadows.", "Even as a child Khurram had sensed tensions all around him \u2013 between his father and his grandfather and between his father and his eldest half-brother Khusrau who, instead of being here to share in the first Nauruz of their father\u2019s reign, was incarcerated in a dungeon in Gwalior.", "Khusrau had been a fool as well as disloyal, Khurram thought, following his father towards a dais draped in silver cloth that had been erected in the centre of the courtyard beneath a canopy of the same material, which shimmered in the light of the torches burning on either side of it.", "Jahangir mounted the dais and began to speak.", "\u2018Tonight is the climax of our Nauruz celebrations when we hail the new lunar year.", "My astrologers tell me that the year ahead will be one of even greater glory for our empire.", "Now is the time to honour the women of my court.", "Until the stars begin to fade from the heavens they, not us, are the masters here.", "Unless we can persuade them otherwise, what they demand for their goods we must pay.", "Let the Royal Meena Bazaar begin.\u2019\n\nJahangir descended from the dais.", "It seemed to Khurram that his father stopped for a moment and looked round him as if seeking someone in particular, and then an expression of disappointment crossed his face.", "But Jahangir composed himself and made his way towards a table spread with maroon velvet presided over by a smiling matron Khurram recognised as one of Parvez\u2019s milk-mothers.", "Parvez followed close behind but Khurram held back.", "The woman was garrulous and he wasn\u2019t in the mood for long stories about himself and his brother as children.", "His tight-fitting coat was heavy and uncomfortable.", "He flexed his broad shoulders beneath the stiff cloth and felt a trickle of sweat run down between his shoulder blades.", "Instead of following his father, Khurram wandered towards a quieter part of the courtyard where he guessed the more junior women had their stalls.", "Perhaps there would be a pretty face among them, though for the moment a round-hipped, high-bosomed dancer from the Agra bazaar was absorbing most of his energies.", "Then Khurram noticed, almost in the shadows of a luxuriant sweep of white-flowered jasmine growing on the courtyard wall, a small stall on which were displayed some pieces of pottery.", "Behind the stall stood a tall, slender girl.", "He couldn\u2019t make out her face but he caught the gleam of pearls and diamonds in the long, thick hair that swung around her as she rearranged her goods.", "Khurram came closer.", "She was humming to herself and wasn\u2019t aware of him until he was standing just a few feet away.", "In her surprise her black eyes widened.", "Khurram had never seen such a perfect face.", "\u2018I didn\u2019t mean to startle you.", "What are you selling?\u2019\n\nThe girl didn\u2019t answer but held out a vase painted in vivid blues and greens.", "It was pretty enough but ordinary.", "However, there was nothing ordinary about those sparkling, thickly lashed eyes shyly watching him.", "Khurram felt stupid and tongue-tied and fixed his gaze on the vase, trying to think of something to say about it.", "\u2018I painted it.", "Do you like it?\u2019 the girl said.", "Raising his eyes to her again he saw she was looking a little amused.", "She must be about fourteen or fifteen, he thought.", "Her skin had the soft sheen of the pearls brought to the court by Arab traders and her wide lips were soft and pink.", "\u2018I like it.", "How much will you take?\u2019\n\n\u2018What will you give?\u2019 She put her head on one side.", "\u2018Anything you ask.\u2019\n\n\u2018You are a rich man, then?\u2019\n\nKhurram\u2019s green eyes flashed in surprise.", "Hadn\u2019t she seen him enter the courtyard and stand by the dais while his father spoke?", "Even if not, surely everyone knew the emperor\u2019s sons .", ".", ".", "\u2018I\u2019m rich enough.\u2019\n\n\u2018Good.\u2019\n\n\u2018How long have you been at court?\u2019\n\n\u2018Four weeks.\u2019\n\n\u2018Where were you before then?\u2019\n\n\u2018My father Asaf Khan is an officer in the emperor\u2019s armies.", "He was serving in the Deccan until the emperor promoted him to command the Agra garrison.\u2019\n\n\u2018Arjumand .", ".", ".", "I hadn\u2019t meant to leave you on your own for so long .", ".", ".\u2019 A woman elegantly dressed in honey-coloured robes whose fine-boned face bore an unmistakable resemblance to the girl\u2019s came hurrying up.", "She was a little out of breath but when she saw Khurram she drew herself up and inclined her head, saying quietly, \u2018Thank you for visiting our stall, Highness.", "Our goods are simple but my granddaughter made them all herself.\u2019\n\n\u2018They are very fine.", "I will buy them all.", "Just name your price.\u2019\n\n\u2018Arjumand, that is for you to say.\u2019\n\nArjumand, who had been studying Khurram earnestly, looked uncertain, then said, \u2018One gold mohur.\u2019\n\n\u2018I will give you ten.", "Qorchi, I need ten mohurs,\u2019 Khurram called to his squire, standing a few feet behind him.", "The qorchi came forward and held out the money to Arjumand.", "\u2018No, give it to me.\u2019 The squire poured the stream of gold coins into his right palm.", "Slowly Khurram raised his hand and offered the money to the girl.", "The breeze was rising and Arjumand looked as if she were bathed in every colour of the rainbow from the glass globes swaying all around.", "She took the coins from him one by one.", "The feel of her fingertips brushing against his skin was the most sensual thing he had ever experienced.", "Shocked, he glanced at her face and saw in her black eyes the proof that she felt the same.", "When the last coin was gone he lowered his hand again.", "He had wanted the feel of her flesh against his to go on for ever .", ".", ".", "Suddenly he felt confused, uncertain what he was feeling.", "\u2018Thank you.\u2019 Turning, he walked quickly away.", "It was only when he was back among the noisy laughing crowds around the main stalls that he realised he hadn\u2019t taken his purchases and that she hadn\u2019t called after him.", "Jamila ran her fingers teasingly across Khurram\u2019s sweat-soaked chest.", "\u2018You were a tiger tonight, Highness.\u2019 She nibbled his ear and on her breath he could smell the cardamom she loved to chew.", "\u2018Stop.\u2019 He pushed her hand away and gently disengaging himself stood up.", "Through the wooden screen that separated the cubicle where she slept from the room next door where she and the rest of the dancers ate, he could see an old woman vigorously sweeping the beaten earth floor with a broom of dry twigs.", "She made a good living from the fees the girls charged their customers.", "Khurram stooped to splash some water from an earthenware dish resting on a metal stand on to his face.", "\u2018What\u2019s the matter?", "Did I displease you?\u2019 Jamila said, but her confident smile showed that she had few doubts about her performance.", "\u2018No.", "Of course you didn\u2019t.\u2019\n\n\u2018Then what is it?\u2019 Jamila turned on her side.", "He looked down at the round pretty face, the plump voluptuousness of the woman who had been his plaything for the past six months.", "He enjoyed the raucous atmosphere of the bazaar and the girls \u2013 so free and easy \u2013 seemed less intimidating than the concubines the khawajasara could have procured for him in the Agra fort where so many eyes were constantly upon him.", "Jamila had taught him all about love-making.", "He had been fumbling, over-eager, but she had shown him how to please a woman and how giving pleasure could enhance his own.", "Her warm pliant body, her inventiveness, had enthralled him.", "But no longer.", "He had thought making love with Jamila would cure him of his obsession with Arjumand but it hadn\u2019t.", "Even while he was possessing Jamila\u2019s body it was Arjumand\u2019s face he saw.", "Though it was two months since the Royal Meena Bazaar, he couldn\u2019t get Asaf Khan\u2019s daughter out of his head.", "\u2018Come back to bed.", "You must have some energy left and I have something new to show you .", ".", ".\u2019 Jamila\u2019s coaxing voice cut into his thoughts.", "She was sitting up, the nipples on her henna-tipped breasts erect, and he felt the familiar stirring in his groin.", "But it would be just one more coupling.", "He and Jamila were like mating beasts, hot and hungry for the moment with no real feeling for each other.", "If he didn\u2019t come to her she would find others, and if she and her dancing troupe left Agra he would easily find a replacement.", "Their frenetic love-making, driving one another beyond control, was no more than the satisfying of an itch.", "Now, with thoughts of Arjumand constantly in his mind, it was no longer enough for him.", "\u2018Father, I want to ask you something.\u2019\n\n\u2018What is it?\u2019 Jahangir put down the miniature painting of a nilgai that he had been examining in his private apartments.", "The court artist had captured every detail, including the bluish tinge of the antelope\u2019s coat, the delicate shape of its eyes .", ".", ".", "Khurram hesitated.", "\u2018Could we be alone .", ".", ".\u2019\n\n\u2018Leave us,\u2019 Jahangir ordered his attendants.", "Almost before the doors had closed behind the last of the servants, Khurram blurted out, \u2018I\u2019d like to take a wife.\u2019\n\nJahangir looked at his son \u2013 nearly sixteen and already tall and muscular as a grown man.", "Few of his officers could beat Khurram at wrestling or in a sword fight.", "\u2018You are right,\u2019 Jahangir looked thoughtful.", "\u2018I was around your age when I took my first wife, but we need not rush.", "I shall consider who would make you a suitable bride.", "The Rajput ruler of Jaisalmer has daughters and an alliance with his family would please our Hindu subjects.", "Or I could look beyond our empire.", "A marriage with one of the Shah of Persia\u2019s family might make him more willing to give up his ambitions to take Kandahar from the Moghuls .", ".", ".\u2019 Jahangir\u2019s mind was racing away.", "He would summon his vizier Majid Khan and perhaps some of his other councillors to discuss the matter.", "\u2018I am pleased you have raised this with me, Khurram.", "It shows your maturity and that you are indeed ready to take your first wife.", "We\u2019ll talk again when I have thought further about it \u2013 but it will be soon, I promise.\u2019\n\n\u2018I already know the woman I would like as my wife.\u2019 Khurram\u2019s tone was emphatic and the expression in his green eyes serious.", "Jahangir blinked in surprise.", "\u2018Who?\u2019\n\n\u2018The daughter of the commander of your garrison in Agra.\u2019\n\n\u2018Asaf Khan\u2019s daughter?", "Where did you see her?\u2019\n\n\u2018At the Royal Meena Bazaar.", "Her name is Arjumand.\u2019\n\n\u2018How old is she?", "Asaf Khan is young to have a daughter of marriageable age.\u2019\n\n\u2018Perhaps a little younger than me.\u2019\n\nJahangir frowned.", "His first impulse had been that this was just some youthful infatuation \u2013 perhaps it still was \u2013 but it was strange.", "The young woman who had caught Khurram\u2019s eye must be Mehrunissa\u2019s niece and thus the granddaughter of his treasurer Ghiyas Beg.", "Something his grandmother Hamida had said to him many years ago when Ghiyas Beg had first arrived penniless and despairing at Akbar\u2019s court came into his mind.", "What was it?", "Something like, So much that happens appears random, yet I have often discerned patterns running through our existence as if at the hand of a divine weaver at the loom .", ".", ".", "one day this Ghiyas Beg might become important to our dynasty.", "Hamida had had the gift of second sight.", "Only a fool would dismiss her words.", "\u2018Khurram.", "You are still very young but I can see that your mind is made up.", "If your heart is set on this girl, I will not object and I myself will slip the betrothal ring on her finger to signal the alliance between her family and ours.", "All that I ask is that you wait a while before you marry.\u2019\n\nJahangir saw the surprise on his son\u2019s face \u2013 clearly he hadn\u2019t anticipated such an easy victory \u2013 but then it gave way to a smile of delight and Khurram embraced him.", "\u2018I will wait and do whatever else you ask .", ".", ".\u2019\n\n\u2018I will summon Asaf Khan.", "There are things he and I should discuss.", "Until that time, be discreet.", "Say nothing about this even to your mother.\u2019\n\nWhen he was alone, Jahangir sat for a while, his head in his hands.", "His interview with Khurram had sparked many thoughts.", "Unlike Khusrau, whose treachery he could still not forgive, Khurram had been nothing but a loyal son of whom any man would be proud.", "He wished he could have been so confident at Khurram\u2019s age and also that he knew his son better, but Akbar\u2019s extreme partiality for his favourite grandson had made that difficult.", "Khurram had been brought up in Akbar\u2019s household.", "It was his grandfather \u2013 not his father \u2013 who had led the procession taking the prince to school for the first time.", "But that was all past, and in recent months father and son had been spending more time together.", "All the same, he had surprised himself by agreeing so readily to Khurram\u2019s request.", "A prince of the Moghul empire could take his pick of wives.", "Though Arjumand came from a noble Persian family it wasn\u2019t a match that would ever have occurred to him.", "But as he knew only too well, choice didn\u2019t always come into it.", "It hadn\u2019t with Humayun and Hamida.", "He hadn\u2019t asked to feel as he did about Mehrunissa so he could hardly blame his son for falling so precipitately in love.", "The women of Ghiyas Beg\u2019s family seemed to possess power to bewitch the men of his own,

whether she was dreaming, but opening sleepy eyes she saw Nadya leaning over her.", "\u2018What is it?", "Why have you woken me?\u2019 The maid had placed a lighted oil lamp on the marble table next to her bed and in the warm draughts blowing through the open casement it cast a flickering orange glow.", "\u2018A note has come for you.", "The messenger who left it at the haram gates said it must be delivered immediately.\u2019 Mehrunissa could see the maid was almost quivering with curiosity.", "Heart thumping, she sat up and took the sealed paper Nadya was holding out to her.", "News that came in the hours of darkness could only be bad.", "Her fingers shook a little as she unfolded the letter and recognised her niece\u2019s flowing hand.", "The note had been written in haste.", "There were uncharacteristic blots and several words had been crossed out.", "Aunt, something terrible has happened.", "My father is away in Delhi on military business and my grandmother and I have no one else to turn to.", "Tonight while I was at my grandparents\u2019 apartments in the fort, guards came to arrest my grandfather.", "They claim he is part of a plot directed by Prince Khusrau from his prison cell in Gwalior to kill the emperor and that Khusrau had promised to reward him for his help in seizing the imperial treasuries by making him his vizier.", "You know what my grandfather is like \u2013 always so calm, so dignified.", "He went quietly, telling us not to worry, but I could see how shocked he was and also that he was afraid.", "There was more, but Mehrunissa could scarcely absorb what she had already read.", "Her father Ghiyas Beg, who had served Akbar and then Jahangir so loyally for over two decades, arrested for plotting to kill the emperor .", ".", ".", "it was incredible.", "For a moment she wondered whether she wasn\u2019t still asleep and this wasn\u2019t some outlandish nightmare, but the high-pitched droning of a mosquito hovering somewhere close, and the strong musky scent of the perfume Nadya always wore, were undeniably real.", "\u2018What is it?", "Not bad news, I hope?\u2019 asked Nadya, eyes bright.", "\u2018It is a family matter.", "You may go, but leave the lamp so I have light to read by.\u2019\n\nWhen she was certain the maid had gone Mehrunissa pushed her long hair back from her face and looked again at Arjumand\u2019s note, her

laughable, and as for her own hopes .", ".", ".", "For a moment she couldn\u2019t help glancing fearfully towards the still-swaying brocade hangings, expecting any moment to see the fragile fabric swept aside as eunuchs and haram guards rushed to arrest her also.", "She must stay calm.", "Holding Arjumand\u2019s note tightly she read on.", "As they were taking my grandfather away one of the guards told him, \u2018Your son Mir Khan was arrested on the same charge in Gwalior two days ago and brought to Agra in chains.\u2019 My grandmother is ill with worry.", "Please help us, Aunt.", "Tell us what we should do.", "The note ended with a scrawled Arjumand.", "Mehrunissa rose from her bed and folding the note placed it carefully on the table beside the oil lamp.", "Then she walked over to

around them.", "From nearby she heard the court timekeeper, the ghariyali, striking the hour \u2013 once, twice, thrice .", ".", ".", "Glancing up at the sky she saw the patterns of bright stars splashed across its inky depths.", "Somehow the stars\u2019 cold remote beauty, so far removed from the troubles of the world, gave her strength, calming her and helping her to think more clearly.",

younger brother, Mir Khan?", "She could not be so sure.", "They had grown up together in Kabul.", "She had always known he lacked her intelligence or that of Asaf Khan \u2013 or their inner strength.", "Mir Khan was vain and didn\u2019t recognise his limitations.", "He was also easily led, as she well knew.", "Time and again when they were children she had coaxed him to some rash act to her benefit not his.", "She still blushed to recall how once she had persuaded him to climb along the rotting limb of an apricot tree to gather fruit for her.", "The branch had broken and he had fallen to the ground.", "That was a long time ago.", "Mir Khan should have learned sense and discretion, but the advancement that had come early to Asaf Khan would never be his.", "Had frustration, jealousy of his elder brother and sugared promises of great rewards prompted him to join some wild scheme?", "She had no way of knowing.", "Her younger brother could be as innocent as Ghiyas Beg.",

the paper and after warming the end of a stick of wax let it drip on to the join and stamped it with her seal, which was engraved with the eagle emblem used by her family in Persia for centuries.",

visitor to her father\u2019s house, but maybe even he would now distance himself from Ghiyas Beg.", "She imagined the vizier holding her letter in the flame of a candle, turning her last hopes to ashes.", "\u2018Come with me at once.\u2019 Mehrunissa spun round.", "She hadn\u2019t heard the khawajasara enter and it was a shock to find Mala barely four feet away.", "The woman\u2019s expression was cold as she gestured towards the door with her staff of office.", "Mehrunissa had dressed in her finest blue silk robe embroidered with irises in silver thread in case the emperor should call for her, but looking at Mala\u2019s disdainful face she doubted whether that was why the khawajasara had come.", "More likely she was being ejected from the imperial haram, in which case she certainly wasn\u2019t going to leave without her favourite possessions like her inkpot and especially her jewels.", "She picked up a fine Kashmir shawl, a gift from Asaf Khan, and was reaching for her jewel casket when the khawajasara snapped, \u2018Leave everything.", "Come exactly as you are now.", "Just veil yourself.\u2019\n\nMehrunissa put down the shawl, fastened her veil and lowered her eyes submissively.", "And so my life goes full circle, she thought, following Mala\u2019s tall, green-clad figure out of her apartment, along the passage and across the haram courtyard where the evening candelabras had already been lit.", "As she saw the sidelong glances, heard the ill-concealed remarks, tears pricked her eyelids but she drew herself up proudly and took her time.", "Though the khawajasara was walking quickly she would not be hurried from the haram like some whipped dog.", "But then she realised that Mala wasn\u2019t leading her towards the haram gates directly in front of them.", "Instead she had turned sharply to the left and was ascending a flight of shallow stone steps leading up to a part of the fort Mehrunissa had never seen.", "Her heart juddered against her ribs.", "Where was Mala taking her?", "The khawajasara paused at the top of the steps and looked back over her shoulder.", "\u2018Hurry up.\u2019 Mehrunissa gathered up the skirt of her blue robe and began to climb.", "Reaching the top she found herself on a broad terrace.", "Directly opposite were tall double doors covered in shining silver leaf inlaid with semi-precious stones.", "Mala was conversing rapidly with four red-turbaned Rajput guards posted outside them and gesticulating towards Mehrunissa.", "The guards flung the doors open.", "Mala waited until Mehrunissa had caught up, then grasping her by the wrist marched her through into a wide corridor lined with brocade hangings.", "The air was heavily perfumed from the incense and spices smouldering in gold burners fashioned like male peacocks, the outspread tails set with emeralds and sapphires.", "Ahead were two further doors even higher and wider and made of gold inlaid with ivory and tortoiseshell.", "Outside these were stationed ten Rajput guards standing to attention with steel-tipped spears.", "\u2018Where are we?\u2019 she whispered to Mala.", "\u2018This is His Majesty\u2019s own entrance into the imperial haram.", "Through those doors are his private apartments.\u2019\n\n\u2018You are taking me to the emperor?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes.", "No doubt he will decide what is to be done with you.\u2019\n\nMehrunissa wasn\u2019t listening.", "In the few precious moments that remained she was running through the speech she had practised over and over in her mind since despatching her letter to Jahangir.", "Those great golden doors were opening now.", "Mala was standing to one side and she must go forward alone.", "Raising her head, she stepped through the doors.", "The emperor was seated on a low dais at the far end of the room.", "Mehrunissa had expected to see qorchis, attendants, guards even, to protect the emperor\u2019s life against the daughter and sister of supposed traitors, but she was alone with him.", "Lengthening shadows falling through the casement and the effect of the flickering candlelight made it hard for her to distinguish Jahangir\u2019s expression.", "When she was still about fifteen feet away, just as she had planned she flung herself face down before him, her loose hair flowing out around her.", "Also as she had planned she didn\u2019t wait for Jahangir to speak.", "\u2018Majesty, thank you for your great goodness in granting me an audience.", "I am here to plead before you on behalf of my father, Ghiyas Beg.", "I swear on my life that he would never do anything to harm you, his benefactor, who has given him everything.", "My father would never plead for himself so I must do it.", "I only seek justice.\u2019 Mehrunissa did not move, face pushed into the thick carpet, arms outstretched on either side of her.", "But from the man on the shadowy dais before her came not a sound.", "She resisted the temptation to raise her head, but just when she felt she could no longer bear not to look at him, his strong hands were under her arms, raising her to her feet.", "She closed her eyes.", "Now that he was so close to her she could not look into his face for fear of what she might see \u2013 condemnation not compassion.", "His hands dropped from her shoulders but then she felt him unfastening one corner of her veil.", "She opened her eyes and for the second time in her life looked into his.", "There was the face she remembered from all those years ago in Kabul.", "No longer unlined but even handsomer except for the hard, cold expression which, as she took it in, made her suddenly feel sick and faint.", "Jahangir was looking at her intently but not a muscle betrayed his thoughts.", "After a few moments he turned away, remounted his dais and sat down again.", "\u2018Your father and your brother have both been questioned.\u2019\n\n\u2018My father is innocent of any crime,\u2019 Mehrunissa said, struggling to keep her voice calm and controlled.", "\u2018Who accuses him?\u2019\n\n\u2018The governor of the Gwalior fortress.", "His spies overheard my son discussing with your brother Mir Khan whether the Shah of Persia might be persuaded to send troops to help overthrow me if he was promised Kandahar.", "Your brother replied that Ghiyas Beg still had influence at the Persian court .", ".", ".", "he implied he might be induced to join in the plot.\u2019\n\nMehrunissa flushed with anger.", "She could just picture Mir Khan so puffed up with conceit at being the confidant of a prince that he would say or do anything .", ".", ".", "She raised her chin.", "\u2018Such an idea is beneath contempt.", "Mir Khan was just trying to impress.", "My father left Persia before I was born.", "He cut all his links with his homeland when he became an official of the Moghul empire which he has served so well.", "Even if he could be bought \u2013 which he could not \u2013 what sense would it make when his granddaughter is about to marry Prince Khurram for him to support another of your sons against you?\u2019\n\nJahangir was regarding her steadily.", "If he still retained any feelings for her, he was hiding them well, she thought.", "\u2018You speak soundly, but even before you argued with such passion I had already decided that Ghiyas Beg had no knowledge of the plot,\u2019 he said at last.", "\u2018I have known him a long time and believe he is a man of integrity.\u2019\n\nMy father is safe, thought Mehrunissa.", "For a moment everything seemed to go dark around her and she put her hand to her eyes, willing herself to be strong.", "\u2018But the same isn\u2019t true of your brother .", ".", ".\u2019\n\n\u2018My brother .", ".", ".\u2019\n\n\u2018The evidence against Mir Khan is overwhelming.", "Even though at first he denied everything, after some .", ".", ".", "let\u2019s say persuasion .", ".", ".", "he has confessed that my traitorous son Prince Khusrau offered him great rewards to join a plot against me and that he agreed.\u2019\n\nMehrunissa said nothing.", "\u2018You came here seeking justice.", "You have just shown me what a logical mind you have.", "What would you do if you were me?\u2019\n\nShe stared down at the richly patterned carpet woven with a design of blood-red flowers against a dark blue background as memories of Mir Khan as a cheerful, thoughtless child edging his way along the rotten bough of the apricot tree, laughing and reaching out his hand to pluck her some fruits, pierced her with an almost physical pain.", "\u2018Majesty.\u2019 Her voice was cool and controlled, with not the slightest tremor.", "\u2018You have no choice.", "Mir Khan is a traitor.", "Execute him.", "That is what I would do if I were you.\u2019\n\n\u2018In your letter you spoke of your love for your family.", "Is it the act of a loving sister to counsel the death of a brother?\u2019\n\n\u2018In Persia there is a saying: \u201cIf a tree produces bitter fruit cut it down to save the rest of the orchard.\u201d Mir Khan has betrayed the duty he owed to you as his emperor and the duty he owes to his family.", "He is the diseased tree.", "The rest of his family are the orchard.\u2019\n\n\u2018Very well.", "Let it be as you advise.\u2019 Leaning down Jahangir picked up a large brass bell beside him and rang it vigorously.", "Its metallic clang had barely sounded more than two or three times before a qorchi entered through a side door to the right of the dais.", "\u2018Majesty?\u2019\n\n\u2018Bring the traitor Mir Khan before me.\u2019\n\nNeither Mehrunissa nor Jahangir, sitting motionless on his dais, spoke as the minutes passed.", "She was steeling herself for the next stage in what had been the longest ordeal of her life.", "It must be about seven o\u2019clock in the evening \u2013 fifteen hours after Nadya had woken her with Arjumand Banu\u2019s terrified note.", "Though mentally exhausted she must not let her resolve weaken.", "Only by keeping strong could she get through this and save herself and her family.", "The sound of male voices and approaching footsteps jerked her out of her thoughts.", "The qorchi came into the apartment through the same side door, then stood to one side of it and called, \u2018Bring in Mir Khan.\u2019\n\nTwo guards entered dragging a third man between them.", "As they approached the dais in the flickering candlelight, Mehrunissa had to force herself not to look away.", "The guards halted level with where she was standing and pushed the man forward on to the ground.", "Mir Khan fell unresistingly.", "Indeed, he looked barely conscious.", "As he had tumbled forward she had seen his battered, bloodied face.", "His clothes were ripped and through the rents she saw what looked like raw, red burn marks on his back, perhaps made with a hot iron.", "She told herself Mir Khan must pay for his mistakes \u2013 that he must be the sacrifice that would save the rest of them \u2013 but it was almost more than she could bear to see her tortured younger brother lying on the floor beside her.", "Conscious that Jahangir\u2019s gaze was fixed on her and not on Mir Khan, she strained to maintain her composure.", "After a moment the emperor turned to the prisoner.", "\u2018Mir Khan, what do you have to say for yourself?\u2019\n\nMir Khan\u2019s whole body was shaking convulsively.", "One of the guards seized his long black hair and pulled back his head.", "\u2018Answer His Majesty.\u2019\n\nMir Khan muttered something incomprehensible and the guard pulled back his booted foot and kicked him hard in the pit of the stomach.", "This time he managed to force out a few words.", "\u2018Forgive me, Majesty.\u2019\n\n\u2018There can be no forgiveness for treachery.", "You deserve a traitor\u2019s death.", "Even your sister has advised your execution.\u2019 Mehrunissa flinched as Mir Khan turned his despairing eyes on her.", "\u2018I should have you crushed beneath the foot of the execution elephant or impaled as I did my son\u2019s supporters in his previous revolt whose fate you were too stupid to learn from.\u2019 Jahangir\u2019s tone was chill.", "It was all Mehrunissa could do not to throw herself down beside Mir Khan and despite her former words plead for mercy for him.", "However, Jahangir went on, \u2018For the sake of your sister who has shown a courage you could never possess I will spare you the slow and agonising departure from this life you deserve.", "Have you anything to say before you die?\u2019\n\nMir Khan struggled to his knees but when he spoke his words were for his sister, not the emperor.", "To her intense relief they were not of anger nor of reproach.", "\u2018Mehrunissa .", ".", ".", "forgive me .", ".", ".\u2019\n\n\u2018I forgive you, brother.\u2019 Her mouth was so dry the words came slowly.", "\u2018And ask our father and Asaf Khan to forgive me too.", "They knew nothing about the plot .", ".", ".", "and tell our mother I love her and not to grieve.\u2019 Mir Khan was sobbing now, tears dissolving the dried blood on his battered face.", "\u2018Send for the executioner,\u2019 Jahangir ordered.", "The man must have been waiting outside for almost at once a tall black-turbaned man in a metal-studded leather tunic holding a double-headed axe and with what looked like a rolled length of animal hide beneath his other muscular arm entered.", "\u2018Majesty?\u2019\n\n\u2018Behead this man.\u2019\n\nHearing Jahangir\u2019s words, Mir Khan collapsed to the floor again.", "The executioner unrolled the hide, then pulled back the carpet in front of the dais and spread the skin out carefully on the stone flags.", "When he was ready he nodded to the guards.", "Mir Khan was still sobbing as the guards grabbed hold of him and dragged him forward on to the hide.", "\u2018Stretch out your neck,\u2019 the executioner ordered.", "As one guard pulled his right arm out from his body, which was now shaking convulsively, and the other guard extended his left one, Mehrunissa watched her brother in what must have been a supreme act of courage slowly extend his own neck.", "The executioner brushed his dark hair from his exposed nape then, satisfied, stepped back and picked up his axe.", "After carefully balancing the weight of it in his hands he looked enquiringly over his shoulder at Jahangir, who gave a brief nod.", "Mehrunissa saw the curved blade gleam in the candlelight as the executioner swung the axe high above him.", "She felt the rush of air against her cheek as he brought it down, then heard the thud of steel on flesh and bone as the blade sliced cleanly through her brother\u2019s neck and saw the bright spurt of blood as his head hit the floor with another duller thud.", "For some moments Mehrunissa was numb.", "Then came a comforting realisation \u2013 the executioner knew his business.", "Her brother hadn\u2019t suffered.", "She had saved him from a slow death.", "She watched the executioner swiftly cocoon Mir Khan\u2019s head and torso in the hide and with the help of one of the guards carry them from the chamber.", "Only a few drops of blood on the flagstones betrayed that just moments ago a life had been taken.", "\u2018It is over,\u2019 Mehrunissa heard Jahangir say.", "\u2018Go back to the haram.\u2019\n\nAll power of thinking and feeling seemed to desert her.", "She obeyed blindly, stumbling towards the great golden doors at the far end of the chamber that were already opening to receive her.", "Back in her apartment in the haram that she\u2019d thought never to see again it was some minutes before Mehrunissa at last allowed the tears to flow.", "Watching her brother\u2019s execution had been hard.", "Her palms were bleeding from where she had dug in her nails in an effort to control herself.", "But Mir Khan had brought his fate on himself.", "He was guilty and justice had been done.", "There was nothing she could have done to save him and had she tried she might have endangered herself and her entire family.", "Just as her father had been prepared to abandon her as a baby to die in the desert to give the rest of his family a chance to survive, so she had had to sacrifice Mir Khan.", "Her act of expediency hadn\u2019t meant she didn\u2019t love him, weak and foolish though he was.", "But what now?", "The meeting with Jahangir she had fantasised about for so long had finally happened but in very different circumstances from those she\u2019d imagined.", "What did the future hold for herself .", ".", ".", "or for her family?"]}
